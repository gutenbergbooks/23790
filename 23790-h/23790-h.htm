<h2>RED SUN RISING</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The star Mira was unpredictably variable. Sometimes
it was blazing, brilliant and hot. Other times it was oddly
dim, cool, shedding little warmth on its many planets.
Gresth Gkae, leader of the Mirans, was seeking a better
star, one to which his "people" could migrate. That star
had to be steady, reliable, with a good planetary system.
And in his astronomical searching, he found Sol.</p>

<p>With hundreds of ships, each larger than whole
Terrestrial spaceports, and traveling faster than the speed
of light, the Mirans set out to move in to Solar regions
and take over.</p>

<p>And on Earth there was nothing which would be capable
of beating off this incredible armada&mdash;until Buck
Kendall stumbled upon THE ULTIMATE WEAPON.</p></div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="blockquot"><p><b>JOHN W. CAMPBELL</b> first started writing in 1930 when
his first short story, <i>When the Atoms Failed</i>, was accepted
by a science-fiction magazine. At that time he
was twenty years old and still a student at college. As the
title of the story indicates, he was even at that time
occupied with the significance of atomic energy and
nuclear physics.</p>

<p>For the next seven years, Campbell, bolstered by a
scientific background that ran from childhood experiments,
to study at Duke University and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, wrote and sold science-fiction,
achieving for himself an enviable reputation in the field.</p>

<p>In 1937 he became the editor of <i>Astounding Stories</i>
magazine and applied himself at once to the task of
bettering the magazine and the field of s-f writing
in general. His influence on science-fiction since then
has been great. Today he still remains as the editor of
that magazine's evolved and redesigned successor,
<i>Analog</i>.</p></div>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Patrol Cruiser</span> "IP-T 247" circling out toward
Pluto on leisurely inspection tour to visit the outpost
miners there, was in no hurry at all as she loafed along. Her
six-man crew was taking it very easy, and easy meant two-man
watches, and low speed, to watch for the instrument
panel and attend ship into the bargain.</p>

<p>She was about thirty million miles off Pluto, just beginning
to get in touch with some of the larger mining stations out
there, when Buck Kendall's turn at the controls came along.
Buck Kendall was one of life's little jokes. When Nature
made him, she was absentminded. Buck stood six feet two
in his stocking feet, with his usual slight stoop in operation.
When he forgot, and stood up straight, he loomed about
two inches higher. He had the body and muscles of a dock
navvy, which Nature started out to make. Then she forgot
and added something of the same stuff she put in Sir
Francis Drake. Maybe that made Old Nature nervous, and
she started adding different things. At any rate, Kendall,
as finally turned out, had a brain that put him in the first
rank of scientists&mdash;when he felt like it&mdash;the general constitution
of an ostrich and a flair for gambling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The present position was due to such a gamble. An IP
man, a friend of his, had made the mistake of betting him a
thousand dollars he wouldn't get beyond a Captain's bars
in the Patrol. Kendall had liked the idea anyway, and adding
a bit of a bet to it made it irresistible. So, being a very
particular kind of a fool, the glorious kind which old Nature
turns out now and then, he left a five million dollar estate on
Long Island, Terra, that same evening, and joined up in the
Patrol. The Sir Francis Drake strain had immediately come
forth&mdash;and Kendall was having the time of his life. In a six-man
cruiser, his real work in the Interplanetary Patrol had
started. He was still in it&mdash;but it was his command now,
and a blue circle on his left sleeve gave his lieutenant's rank.</p>

<p>Buck Kendall had immediately proceeded to enlist in his
command the IP man who had made the mistaken bet, and
Rad Cole was on duty with him now. Cole was the technician
of the T-247. His rank as Technical Engineer was practically
equivalent to Kendall's circle-rank, which made the two
more comfortable together.</p>

<p>Cole was listening carefully to the signals coming through
from Pluto. "That," he decided, "sounds like Tad Nichols'
fist. You can recognize that broken-down truck-horse trot
of his on the key as far away as you can hear it."</p>

<p>"Is that what it is?" sighed Buck. "I thought it was
static mushing him at first. What's he like?"</p>

<p>"Like all the other damn fools who come out two billion
miles to scratch rock, as if there weren't enough already
on the inner planets. He's got a rich platinum property.
Sells ninety percent of his output to buy his power,
and the other eleven percent for his clothes and food."</p>

<p>"He must be an efficient miner," suggested Kendall, "to
maintain 101% production like that."</p>

<p>"No, but his bank account is. He's figured out that's the
most economic level of production. If he produces less, he
won't be able to pay for his heating power, and if he produces
more, his operation power will burn up his bank account
too fast."</p>

<p>"Hmmm&mdash;sensible way to figure. A man after my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
heart. How does he plan to restock his bank account?"</p>

<p>"By mining on Mercury. He does it regularly&mdash;sort of a
commuter. Out here his power bills eat it up. On Mercury
he goes in for potassium, and sells the power he collects
in cooling his dome, of course. He's a good miner, and the
old fool can make money down there." Like any really skilled
operator, Cole had been sending Morse messages while he
talked. Now he sat quiet waiting for the reply, glancing at
the chronometer.</p>

<p>"I take it he's not after money&mdash;just after fun," suggested
Buck.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He's after money," replied Cole gravely. "You
ask him&mdash;he's going to make his eternal fortune yet by
striking a real bed of jovium, and then he'll retire."</p>

<p>"Oh, one of that kind."</p>

<p>"They all are," Cole laughed. "Eternal hope, and the rest
of it." He listened a moment and went on. "But old Nichols is
a first-grade engineer. He wouldn't be able to remake that
bankroll every time if he wasn't. You'll see his Dome out
there on Pluto&mdash;it's always the best on the planet. Tip-top
shape. And he's a bit of an experimenter too. Ah&mdash;he's with
us."</p>

<p>Nichols' ragged signals were coming through&mdash;or pounding
through. They were worse than usual, and at first Kendall
and Cole couldn't make them out. Then finally they got them
in bursts. The man was excited, and his bad key-work
made it worse. "&mdash;Randing stopped. They got him I think.
He said&mdash;th&mdash;ship as big&mdash;a&mdash;nsport. Said it wa&mdash;eaded my&mdash;ay.
Neutrons&mdash;on instruments&mdash;he's coming over the horizon&mdash;it's
huge&mdash;war ship I think&mdash;register&mdash;instru&mdash;neutrons&mdash;."
Abruptly the signals were blanked out completely.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Cole and Kendall sat frozen and stiff. Each looked at the
other abruptly, then Kendall moved. From the receiver, he
ripped out the recording coil, and instantly jammed it into
the analyzer. He started it through once, then again, then
again, at different tone settings, till he found a very shrill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
whine that seemed to clear up most of Nichols' bad key-work.
"T-247&mdash;T-247&mdash;Emergency. Emergency. Randing reports
the&mdash;over his horizon. Huge&mdash;ip&mdash;reign manufacture.
Almost spherical. Randing's stopped. They got him I think.
He said the ship was as big as a transport. Said it was
headed my way. Neutrons&mdash;ont&mdash;gister&mdash;instruments. I think&mdash;is
h&mdash;he's coming over the horizon. It's huge, and a war
ship I think&mdash;register&mdash;instruments&mdash;neutrons."</p>

<p>Kendall's finger stabbed out at a button. Instantly the
noise of the other men, wakened abruptly by the mild
shocks, came from behind. Kendall swung to the controls,
and Cole raced back to the engine room. The hundred-foot
ship shot suddenly forward under the thrust of her
tail ion-rockets. A blue-red cloud formed slowly behind her
and expanded. Talbot appeared, and silently took her over
from Kendall. "Stations, men," snapped Kendall. "Emergency
call from a miner of Pluto reporting a large armed vessel
which attacked them." Kendall swung back, and eased himself
against the thrusting acceleration of the over-powered
little ship, toward the engine room. Cole was bending over
his apparatus, making careful check-ups, closing weapon-circuits.
No window gave view of space here; on the left
was the tiny tender's pocket, on the right, above and below
the great water tanks that fed the ion-rockets, behind the
rockets themselves. The tungsten metal walls were cold and
gray under the ship lights; the hunched bulks of the apparatus
crowded the tiny room. Gigantic racked accumulators
huddled in the corners. Martin and Garnet swung into position
in the fighting-tanks just ahead of the power rooms;
Canning slid rapidly through the engine room, oozed through
a tiny door, and took up his position in the stern-chamber,
seated half-over the great ion-rocket sheath.</p>

<p>"Ready in positions, Captain Kendall," called the war-pilot
as the little green lights appeared on his board.</p>

<p>"Test discharges on maximum," ordered Kendall. He turned
to Cole. "You start the automatic key?"</p>

<p>"Right, Captain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"All shipshape?"</p>

<p>"Right as can be. Accumulators at thirty-seven per cent,
thanks to the loaf out here. They ought to pick up our
signal back on Jupiter, he's nearest now. The station on
Europa will get it."</p>

<p>"Talbot&mdash;we are only to investigate if the ship is as reported.
Have you seen any signs of her?"</p>

<p>"No sir, and the signals are blank."</p>

<p>"I'll work from here." Kendall took his position at the
commanding control. Cole made way for him, and moved
to the power board. One by one he tested the automatic
doors, the pressure bulkheads. Kendall watched the instruments
as one after another of the weapons were tested on
momentary full discharge&mdash;titanic flames of five million volt
protons. Then the ship thudded to the chatter of the Garnell
rifles.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Tensely the men watched the planet ahead, white, yet
barely visible in the weak sunlight so far out. It was swimming
slowly nearer as the tiny ship gathered speed.</p>

<p>Kendall cast a glance over his detector-instruments. The
radio network was undisturbed, the magnetic and electric
fields recognized only the slight disturbances occasioned by
the planet itself. There was nothing, noth&mdash;</p>

<p>Five hundred miles away, a gigantic ship came into instantaneous
being. Simultaneously, and instantaneously, the
various detector systems howled their warnings. Kendall
gasped as the thing appeared on his view screen, with the
scale-lines below. The scale must be cock-eyed. They said
the ship was fifteen hundred feet in diameter, and two
thousand long!</p>

<p>"Retreat," ordered Kendall, "at maximum acceleration."</p>

<p>Talbot was already acting. The gyroscopes hummed in
their castings, and the motors creaked. The T-247 spun on
her axis, and abruptly the acceleration built up as the ion-rockets
began to shudder. A faint smell of "heat" began to
creep out of the converter. Immense "weight" built up,
and pressed the men into their specially designed seats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The gigantic ship across the way turned slowly, and
seemed to stare at the T-247. Then it darted toward them
at incredible speed till the poor little T-247 seemed to be
standing still, as sailors say. The stranger was so gigantic
now, the screens could not show all of him.</p>

<p>"God, Buck&mdash;he's going to take us!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the T-247 rolled, and from her broke every
possible stream of destruction. The ion-rocket flames swirled
abruptly toward her, the proton-guns whined their song of
death in their housings, and the heavy pounding shudder of
the Garnell guns racked the ship.</p>

<p>Strangely, Kendall suddenly noticed, there was a stillness
in the ship. The guns and the rays were still going&mdash;but
the little human sounds seemed abruptly gone.</p>

<p>"Talbot&mdash;Garnet&mdash;" Only silence answered him. Cole
looked across at him in sudden white-faced amazement.</p>

<p>"They're gone&mdash;" gasped Cole.</p>

<p>Kendall stood paralyzed for thirty seconds. Then suddenly
he seemed to come to life. "Neutrons! Neutrons&mdash;and
water tanks! Old Nichols was right&mdash;" He turned to his
friend. "Cole&mdash;the tender&mdash;quick." He darted a glance at
the screen. The giant ship still lay alongside. A wash of
ions was curling around her, splitting, and passing on. The
pinprick explosions of the Garnell shells dotted space around
her&mdash;but never on her.</p>

<p>Cole was already racing for the tender lock. In an instant
Kendall piled in after him. The tiny ship, scarcely ten feet
long, was powered for flights of only two hours acceleration,
and had oxygen for but twenty-four hours for six
men, seventy-two hours for two men&mdash;maybe. The heavy
door was slammed shut behind them, as Cole seated himself
at the panel. He depressed a lever, and a sudden smooth
push shot them away from the T-247.</p>

<p>"DON'T!" called Kendall sharply as Cole reached for the
ion-rocket control. "Douse those lights!" The ship was dark
in dark space. The lighted hull of the T-247 drifted away
from the little tender&mdash;further and further till the giant ship
on the far side became visible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a light&mdash;not a sign of fields in operation." Kendall
said, unconsciously speaking softly. "This thing is so tiny, that
it may escape their observation in the fields of the T-247 and
Pluto down there. It's our only hope."</p>

<p>"What happened? How in the name of the planets did
they kill those men without a sound, without a flash, and
without even warning us, or injuring us?"</p>

<p>"Neutrons&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't. I'm no scientist&mdash;merely a technician.
Neutrons aren't used in any process I've run across."</p>

<p>"Well, remember they're uncharged, tiny things. Small
as protons, but without electric field. The result is they
pass right through an ordinary atom without being stopped
unless they make a direct hit. Tungsten, while it has a beautifully
high melting point, is mostly open space, and a neutron
just sails right through it, or any heavy atom. Light atoms stop
neutrons better&mdash;there's less open space in 'em. Hydrogen
is best. Well&mdash;a man is made up mostly of light elements,
and a man stops those neutrons&mdash;it isn't surprising it killed
those other fellows invisibly, and without a sound."</p>

<p>"You mean they bathed that ship in neutrons?"</p>

<p>"Shot it full of 'em. Just like our proton guns, only sending
neutrons."</p>

<p>"Well, why weren't we killed too?"</p>

<p>"'Water stops neutrons,' I said. Figure it out."</p>

<p>"The rocket-water tanks&mdash;all around us! Great masses of
water&mdash;" gasped Cole. "That saved us?"</p>

<p>"Right. I wonder if they've spotted us."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>The stranger ship was moving slowly in relation to the T-247.
Suddenly the motion changed, the stranger spun&mdash;and a
giant lock appeared in her side, opened. The T-247 began
to move, floated more and more rapidly straight for the
lock. Her various weapons had stopped operating now, the
hoppers of the Garnell guns exhausted, the charge of the accumulators
aboard the ship down so low the proton guns
had died out.</p>

<p>"Lord&mdash;they're taking the whole ship!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say&mdash;Cole, is that any ship you ever heard of before?
<i>I don't think that's just a pirate!</i>"</p>

<p>"Not a pirate&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"How'd he get inside our detector screens so fast? Watch&mdash;he'll
either leave, or come after us&mdash;" The T-247 had
settled inside the lock now, and the great metal door closed
after it. The whole patrol ship had been swallowed by a
giant. Kendall was sketching swiftly on a notebook, watching
the vast ship closely, putting down a record of its lines, and
formation. He glanced up at it, and then down for a few
more lines, and up at it&mdash;</p>

<p>The stranger ship abruptly dwindled. It dwindled with
incredible speed, rushing off along the line of sight at an
impossible velocity, and abruptly clicking out of sight, like
an image on a movie-film that has been cut, and repaired
after the scene that showed the final disappearance.</p>

<p>"Cole&mdash;Cole&mdash;did you get that? Did you see&mdash;do you understand
what happened?" Kendall was excitedly shouting
now.</p>

<p>"He missed us," Cole sighed. "It's a wonder&mdash;hanging out
here in space, with the protector of the T-247's fields gone."</p>

<p>"No, no, you asteroid&mdash;that's not it. <i>He went off faster than
light itself!</i>"</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;what? Faster than <i>light</i>? That can't be done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He did it, I know he did. That's how he got inside our
screens. He came inside faster than the warning message
could relay back the information. Didn't you see him accelerate
to an impossible speed in an impossible time? Didn't
you see how he just vanished as he exceeded the speed
of light, and stopped reflecting it? <i>That ship was no ship
of this solar system!</i>"</p>

<p>"Where did he come from then?"</p>

<p>"God only knows, but it's a long, long way off."</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> IP-M-122 picked them up. The M-122 got out there
two days later, in response to the calls the T-247 had sent
out. As soon as she got within ten million miles of the little
tender, she began getting Cole's signals, and within twelve
hours had reached the tiny thing, located it, and picked it
up.</p>

<p>Captain Jim Warren was in command, one of the old
school commanders of the IP. He listened to Kendall's report,
listened to Cole's tale&mdash;and radioed back a report of
his own. Space pirates in a large ship had attacked the
T-247, he said, and carried it away. He advised a close
watch. On Pluto, his investigations disclosed nothing more
than the fact that three mines had been raided, all platinum
supplies taken, and the records and machinery removed.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>The M-122 was a fifty-man patrol cruiser, and Warren
felt sure he could handle the menace alone, and hung around
for over two weeks looking for it. He saw nothing, and no
further reports came of attack. Again and again, Kendall tried
to convince him this ship he was hunting was no mere space
pirate, and again and again Warren grunted, and went
on his way. He would not send in any report Kendall made
out, because to do so would add his endorsement to that
report. He would not take Kendall back, though that was
well within his authority.</p>

<p>In fact, it was a full month before Kendall again set
foot on any of the Minor Planets, and then it was Mars,
the base of the M-122. Kendall and Cole took passage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
immediately on an IP supply ship, and landed in New York
six days later. At once, Kendall headed for Commander
McLaurin's office. Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP, found
he would have to make regular application to see McLaurin
through a dozen intermediate officers.</p>

<p>By this time, Kendall was savagely determined to see
McLaurin himself, and see him in the least possible time.
Cole, too, was beginning to believe in Kendall's assertion
of the stranger ship's extra-systemic origin. As yet neither
could understand the strange actions of the machine, its
attack on the Pluto mines, and the capture and theft of a
patrol ship.</p>

<p>"There is," said Kendall angrily, "just one way to see McLaurin
and see him quick. And, by God, I'm going to. Will
you resign with me, Cole? I'll see him within a week then,
I'll bet."</p>

<p>For a minute, Cole hesitated. Then he shook hands with
his friends. "Today!" And that day it was. They resigned, together.
Immediately, Buck Kendall got the machinery in motion
for an interview, working now from the outside, pulling
the strings with the weight of a hundred million dollar fortune.
Even the IP officers had to pay a bit of attention when
Bernard Kendall, multi-millionaire began talking and demanding
things. Within a week, Kendall <i>did</i> see McLaurin.</p>

<p>At that time, McLaurin was fifty-three years old, his crisp
hair still black as space, with scarcely a touch of the gray
that appears in his more recent photographs. He stood six
feet tall, a broad-shouldered, powerful man, his face grave
with lines of intelligence and character. There was also a
permanent narrowing of the eyes, from years under the blazing
sun of space. But most of all, while those years in space
had narrowed and set his eyes, they had not narrowed and
set his mind. An infinitely finer character than old Jim
Warren, his experience in space had taught him always to
expect the unexpected, to understand the incomprehensible
as being part of the unknown and incalculable properties of
space and the worlds that swam in it. Besides the fine technical
education he had started with, he had acquired a liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
education in mankind. When Buck Kendall, straight and
powerful, came into his office with Cole, he recognized in him
a character that would drive steadily and straight for its
goal. Also, he recognized behind the millionaire that had
succeeded in pulling wires enough to see him, the scientist
who had had more than one paper published "in an amateur
way."</p>

<p>"Dr. Bernard Kendall?" he asked, rising.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Late Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP. I quit
and got Cole here to quit with me, so we could see you."</p>

<p>"Unusual tactics. I've had several men join up to get an
interview with me." McLaurin smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can imagine that, but we had to see you in a
hurry. A hidebound old rapscallion by the name of Jim
Warren picked us up out by Pluto, floating around in a six-man
tender. We made some reports to him, but he wouldn't
believe, and he wouldn't send them through&mdash;so we had to
send ourselves through. Sir, this system is about to be attacked
by some extra-systemic race. The IP-T-247 was so
attacked, her crew killed off, and the ship itself carried away."</p>

<p>"I got the report Captain Jim Warren sent through, stating
it was a gang of space pirates. Now what makes you believe
otherwise?"</p>

<p>"That ship that attacked us, attacked with a neutron
gun, a gun that shot neutrons through the hull of our ship
as easily as protons pass through open space. Those neutrons
killed off four of the crew, and spared us only because
we happened to be behind the water tanks. Masses of
hydrogen will stop neutrons, so we lived, and escaped in
the tender. The little tender, lightless, escaped their observation,
and we were picked up. Now, when the 247 had
been picked up, and locked into their ship, that ship started
accelerating. It accelerated so fast along my line of sight
that it just dwindled, and&mdash;vanished. It didn't vanish in
distance, it vanished <i>because it exceeded the speed of light</i>."</p>

<p>"Isn't that impossible?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. It can be done&mdash;if you can find some way of
escaping from this space to do it. Now if you could cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
across through a higher dimension, your <i>projection</i> in this
dimension might easily exceed the speed of light. For instance,
if I could cut directly through the Earth, at a speed
of one thousand miles an hour, my projection on the surface
would go twelve thousand miles while I was going eight.
Similar, if you could cut <i>through</i> the four dimensional space
instead of following its surface, you'd attain a speed greater
than light."</p>

<p>"Might it not still be a space pirate? That's a lot easier
to believe, even allowing your statement that he exceeded
the speed of light."</p>

<p>"If you invented a neutron gun which could kill through
tungsten walls without injuring anything within, a system
of accelerating a ship that didn't affect the inhabitants of that
ship, and a means of exceeding the speed of light, all within
a few months of each other, would you become a pirate?
I wouldn't, and I don't think any one else would. A pirate
is a man who seeks adventure and relief from work. Given
a means of exceeding the speed of light, I'd get all the adventure
I wanted investigating other planets. If I didn't
have a cent before, I'd have relief from work by selling it for
a few hundred millions&mdash;and I'd sell it mighty easily too,
for an invention like that is worth an incalculable sum. Tie
to that the value of compensated acceleration, and no
man's going to turn pirate. He can make more millions selling
his inventions than he can make thousands turning
pirate with them. So who'd turn pirate?"</p>

<p>"Right." McLaurin nodded. "I see your point. Now before
I'd accept your statements <i>in re</i> the 'speed of light'
thing, I'd want opinions from some IP physicists."</p>

<p>"Then let's have a conference, because something's got to
be done soon. I don't know why we haven't heard further
from that fellow."</p>

<p>"Privately&mdash;we have," McLaurin said in a slightly worried
tone. "He was detected by the instruments of every
IP observatory I suspect. We got the reports but didn't
know what to make of them. They indicated so many funny
things, they were sent in as accidental misreadings of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
instruments. But since <i>all</i> the observatories reported them,
similar misreadings, at about the same times, that is with
variations of only a few hours, we thought something must
have been up. The only thing was the phenomena were
reported progressively from Pluto to Neptune, clear across the
solar system, in a definite progression, but at a velocity of
crossing that didn't tie in with any conceivable force. They
crossed faster than the velocity of light. That ship must have
spent about half an hour off each planet before passing on
to the next. And, accepting your faster-than-light explanation,
we can understand it."</p>

<p>"Then I think you have proof."</p>

<p>"If we have, what would you do about it?"</p>

<p>"Get to work on those 'misreadings' of the instruments
for one thing, and for a second, and more important, line
every IP ship with paraffin blocks six inches thick."</p>

<p>"Paraffin&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"The easiest form of hydrogen to get. You can't use solid
hydrogen, because that melts too easily. Water can be turned
into steam too easily, and requires more work. Paraffin
is a solid that's largely hydrogen. That's what they've
always used on neutrons since they discovered them. Confine
your paraffin between tungsten walls, and you'll stop
the secondary protons as well as the neutrons."</p>

<p>"Hmmm&mdash;I suppose so. How about seeing those physicists?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see them today, sir. The sooner you get
started on this work, the better it will be for the IP."</p>

<p>"Having seen me, will you join up in the IP again?"
asked McLaurin.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't think I will. I have another field you
know, in which I may be more useful. Cole here's a better
technician than fighter&mdash;and a darned good fighter, too&mdash;and
I think that an inexperienced space-captain is a lot
less useful than a second-rate physicist at work in a laboratory.
If we hope to get anywhere, or for that matter, I
suspect, stay anywhere, we'll have to do a lot of research
pretty promptly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your explanation of that ship?"</p>

<p>"One of two things: an inventor of some other system
trying out his latest toy, or an expedition sent out by a
planetary government for exploration. I favor the latter for
two reasons: that ship was <i>big</i>. No inventor would build a
thing that size, requiring a crew of several hundred men to
try out his invention. A government would build just about
that if they wanted to send out an expedition. If it were an
inventor, he'd be interested in meeting other people, to see
what they had in the way of science, and probably he'd
want to do it in a peaceable way. That fellow wasn't interested
in peace, by any means. So I think it's a government
ship, and an unfriendly government. They sent that ship
out either for scientific research, for trade research and
exploration, or for acquisitive exploration. If they were out
for scientific research, they'd proceed as would the inventor,
to establish friendly communication. If they were out
for trade, the same would apply. If they were out for acquisitive
exploration, they'd investigate the planets, the sun,
the people, only to the extent of learning how best to
overcome them. They'd want to get a sample of our people,
and a sample of our weapons. They'd want samples of our
machinery, our literature and our technology. That's exactly
what that ship got.</p>

<p>"Somebody, somewhere out there in space, either doesn't
like their home, or wants more home. They've been out
looking for one. I'll bet they sent out hundreds of expeditions
to thousands of nearby stars, gradually going further
and further, seeking a planetary system. This is probably
the one and only one they found. It's a good one too.
It has planets at all temperatures, of all sizes. It is a fairly
compact one, it has a stable sun that will last far longer than
any race can hope to."</p>

<p>"Hmm&mdash;how can there be good and bad planetary systems?"
asked McLaurin. "I'd never thought of that."</p>

<p>Kendall laughed. "Mighty easy. How'd you like to live
on a planet of a Cepheid Variable? Pleasant situation, with
the radiation flaring up and down. How'd you like to live on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a planet of Antares? That blasted sun is so big, to have a
comfortable planet you'd have to be at least ten billion miles
out. Then if you had an interplanetary commerce, you'd
have to struggle with orbits tens of billions of miles across
instead of mere millions. Further, you'd have a sun so blasted
big, it would take an impossible amount of energy to lift
the ship up from one planet to another. If your trip was,
say, twenty billions of miles to the next planet, you'd be
fighting a gravity as bad as the solar gravity at Earth
here all the way&mdash;no decline with a little distance like
that."</p>

<p>"H-m-m-m&mdash;quite true. Then I should say that Mira
would take the prize. It's a red giant, and it's an irregular
variable. The sunlight there would be as unstable as the
weather in New England. It's almost as big as Antares, and
it won't hold still. Now that <i>would</i> make a bad planetary
system."</p>

<p>"It would!" Kendall laughed. But as we know&mdash;he laughed
too soon, and he shouldn't have used the conditional. He
should have said, "It does!"</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Gresth Gkae</span>, Commander of Expeditionary Force 93, of
the Planet Sthor, was returning homeward with joyful mind.
In the lock of his great ship, lay the T-247. In her cargo
holds lay various items of machinery, mining supplies, foods,
and records. And in her log books lay the records of many
readings on the nine larger planets of a highly satisfactory
planetary system.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae had spent no less than three ultra-wearing
years going from one sun to another in a definitely mapped
out section of space. He had investigated only eleven stars in
that time, eleven stars, progressively further from the titanic
red-flaming sun he knew as "the" sun. He knew it as
"the" sun, and had several other appellations for it. Mira
was so-named by Earthmen because it was indeed a "wonder"
star, in Latin, mirare means "to wonder." Irregularly, and
for no apparent reason it would change its rate of radiation.
So far as those inhabitants of Sthor and her sister world Asthor
knew, there was no reason. It just did it. Perhaps with
malicious intent to be annoying. If so, it was exceptionally
successful. Sthor and Asthor experienced, periodically, a
young ice age. When Mira decided to take a rest, Sthor
and Asthor froze up, from the poles most of the way to the
equators. Then Mira would stretch herself a little, move
about restlessly and Sthor and Asthor would become uninhabitably
hot, anywhere within twenty degrees of the
equator.</p>

<p>Those Sthorian people had evolved in a way that made
the conditions endurable for savage or uncivilized people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but when a scientific civilization with a well-ordered mode of
existence tried to establish itself, Mira was all sorts of a
nuisance.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae was a peculiar individual to human ways of
thinking. He stood some seven feet tall, on his strange, double-kneed
legs and his four toed feet. His body was covered
with little, short feather-like things that moved now with a
volition of their own. They were moving very slowly and
regularly. The space-ship was heated to a comfortable
temperature, and the little fans were helping to cool Gresth
Gkae. Had it been cold, every little feather would have
lain down close against its neighbors, forming an admirable,
wind-proof and cold-proof blanket.</p>

<p>Nature, on Sthor, had original ideas of arrangement too.
Sthorians possessed two eyes&mdash;one directly above the other,
in the center of their faces. The face was so long, and narrow,
it resembled a blunt hatchet, with the two eyes on the
edge. To counter-balance this vertical arrangement of the
eyes, the nostrils had been separated some four inches, with
one on each of the sloping cheeks. His ears were little pink-flesh
cups on short, muscular stems. His mouth was narrow,
and small, but armed with quite solid teeth adapted to
his diet, a diet consisting of almost anything any creature
had ever considered edible. Like most successful forms of
intelligent life, Gresth Gkae was omnivorous. An intelligent
form of life is necessarily adaptable, and adaptation meant
being able to eat what was at hand.</p>

<p>One of his eyes, the upper one, was fully twice the size
of the lower one. This was his telescopic eye. The lower, or
microscopic eye was adapted to work for which a human
being would have required a low power microscope, the
upper eye possessed a more normal power of vision, <i>plus</i>
considerable telescopic powers.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae was using it now to look ahead in the blank
of space to where gigantic Mira appeared. On his screens
now, Mira appeared deep violet, for he was approaching
at a speed greater than that of light, and even this projected
light of Mira was badly distorted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"The distance is half a light-year now, sir," reported the
navigation officer.</p>

<p>"Reduce the speed, then, to normal velocity for these
ranges. What reserve of fuel have we?"</p>

<p>"Less than one thousand pounds. We will barely be able
to stop. We were too free in the use of our weapons,
I fear," replied the Chief Technician.</p>

<p>"Well, what would you? We needed those things in our
reports. Besides, we could extract fuel from that ore we took
on at Planet Nine of Phahlo. It is merely that I wish speed
in the return."</p>

<p>"As we all do. How soon do you believe the Council will
proceed against the new system?"</p>

<p>"It will be fully a year, I fear. They must gather the
expeditions together, and re-equip the ships. It will be a
long time before all will have come in."</p>

<p>"Could they not send fast ships after them to recall
them?"</p>

<p>"Could they have traced us as we wove our way from
Thart to Karst to Raloork to Phahlo? It would be impossible."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Steadily the great ship had been boring on her way. Mira
had been a disc for nearly two days, gigantic, two-hundred-and-fifty-million-mile
Mira took a great deal of dwarfing by
distance to lose her disc. Even at the Twin Planets, eight
thousand two hundred and fifty millions of miles out, Mira
covered half the sky, it seemed, red and angry. Sometimes,
though, to the disgust of the Sthorians it was just red-faced
and lazy. Then Sthor froze.</p>

<p>"Grih is in a descendant stage," said the navigation officer
presently. "Sthor will be cold when we arrive."</p>

<p>"It will warm quickly enough with our news!" Gresth
laughed. "A system&mdash;a delightful system&mdash;discovered. A
system of many close-grouped planets. Why think&mdash;from one
side of that system to the other is less of a distance than
from Ansthat, our first planet's orbit, to Insthor's orbit! That
sun, as we know, is steady and warm. All will be well, when
we have eliminated that rather peculiar race. Odd, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they should, in some ways, be so nearly like us! Nearly Sthorian
in build. I would not have expected it. Though they
did have some amazing peculiarities! Imagine&mdash;two eyes
just alike, and in a horizontal row. And that flat face.
They looked as though they had suffered some accident
that smashed the front of the face in. And also the peculiar
beak-like projection. Why should a race ever develop so
amazing a projection in so peculiar and exposed a position?
It sticks out inviting attack and injury. Right in the middle
of the face. And to make it worse, there is the air-channel,
and the only air channel. Why, one minor injury to the throat
would be certain to damage that passage beyond repair, and
bring death. Yet such relatively unimportant things as ears,
and eyes are doubled. Surely you would expect that so important
a member as the air-passage would be doubled
for safety.</p>

<p>"Those strange, awkward arms and legs were what
puzzled me. I have been attempting to manipulate myself
as they must be forced to, and I cannot see how delicate or
accurate manual manipulation would be possible with those
rigid, inflexible arms. In some ways I feel they must have
had clever minds to overcome so great a handicap to constructive
work. But I suppose single joints in the arms become
as natural to them as our own more mobile two.</p>

<p>"I wonder if life in any intelligent form wouldn't develop
somewhat similar formations, though. Think, in all parts of
Sthor, before men became civilized and developed communication,
even so much as twenty thousand years ago, our
records show that seats and chairs were much as they are
today, and much as they are, in all places among all groups.
Then too, the eye has developed in many different species,
and always reached much the same structure. When a thing
is intended and developed to serve a given purpose, no matter
who develops it, or where or how, is it not apt to have
similar shapes and parts? A chair must have legs, and a
seat and arm-rests and a back. You may vary their nature
and their shape, but not widely, and they must be there.
An eye must, anywhere, have a sensitive retina, an adjustable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lens, and an adjustable device for controlling the entrance
of light. Similarly there are certain functions that
the body of an intelligent creature must serve which naturally
tend to make intelligent creatures similar. He must have a
tool&mdash;the hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I see your point. It must be so, for surely these
creatures out there are strange enough in other ways."</p>

<p>"But tell me, have you calculated when we shall land?"</p>

<p>"In twelve hours, thirty-three minutes, sir."</p>

<p>Eleven hours later, the expedition ship had slowed to
a normal space-speed. On her left hung the giant globe of
Asthor, rotating slowly, moving slowly in her orbit. Directly
ahead, Sthor loomed even greater. Tiny Teelan, the thousand-mile
diameter moon of the Insthor system shone dull red
in the reflected light of gigantic Mira. Mira herself was gigantic,
red and menacing across eight and a quarter billions
of miles of space.</p>

<p>One hundred thousand miles apart, the twin worlds Sthor
and Asthor rotated about their common center of gravity,
eternally facing each other. Ten million miles from their common
center of gravity, Teelan rotated in a vast orbit.</p>

<p>Sthor and Asthor were capped at each pole now by gigantic
white icecaps. Mira was sulking, and as a consequence
the planets were freezing.</p>

<p>The expedition ship sank slowly toward Sthor. A swarm
of smaller craft had flown up at its approach to meet it.
A gaily-colored small ship marked the official greeting-ship.
Gresth had withheld his news purposely. Now suddenly he
began broadcasting it from the powerful transmitter on his
ship. As the words came through on a thousand sets, all
the little ships began to whirl, dance and break out into
glowing, sparkling lights. On Sthor and Asthor even commotions
began to be visible. A new planetary system had
been found&mdash; They could move! Their overflowing populations
could be spread out!</p>

<p>The whole Insthor system went mad with delight as the
great Expeditionary Ship settled downward.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a glint of humor in Buck Kendall's eyes as he
passed the sheet over to McLaurin. Commander McLaurin
looked down the columns with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>"'Petition to establish the Lunar Mining Bank,'" he read.
"What a bank! Officers: President, General James Logan, late
of the IP; Vice-president, Colonel Warren Gerardhi, also late
of the IP; Staff, consists of 90% ex-IP men, and a few scattered
accountants. Designed by the well-known designer
of IP stations, Colonel Richard Murray." Commander McLaurin
looked up at Kendall with a broad grin. "And you
actually got Interplanetary Life to give you a mortgage on the
structure?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It'll cut cost fifty-eight millions, with its twelve-foot
tungsten-beryllium walls and the heavy defense weapons
against those terrible pirates. You know we must defend our
property."</p>

<p>"With the thing you're setting up out there on Luna, you
could more readily wipe out the IP than anything else I
know of. Any new defense ideas?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. Did you get any further appropriations from the
IP Appropriations Board?"</p>

<p>McLaurin looked sour. "No. The dear taxpayers might object,
and those thickheaded, clogged rockets on the Board
can't see your data on the Stranger. They gave me just
ten millions, and that only because you demonstrated you
could shoot every living thing out of the latest IP cruiser
with that neutron gun of yours. By the way, they may
kick when I don't install more than a few of those."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let 'em. You can stall for a few months. You'll need that
money more for other purposes. You've installed that paraffin
lining?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I got a report on that of 'finished' last week. How
have you made out?"</p>

<p>Buck Kendall's face fell. "Not so hot. Devin's been the
biggest help&mdash;he did most of the work on that neutron gun
really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After," McLaurin interrupted, "you told him how."</p>

<p>"&mdash;but we're pretty well stuck now, it seems. You'll be
off duty tomorrow evening, can't you drop around to the
lab? We're going to try out a new system for releasing atomic
energy."</p>

<p>"Isn't that a pretty faint hope? We've been trying to get
it for three centuries now, and haven't yet. What chance
at it within a year or so?&mdash;which is the time you allow
yourself before the Stranger returns."</p>

<p>"It is, I'll admit that. But there's another factor, not to
be forgotten. The data we got from correlating those 'misreadings'
from the various IP posts mean a lot. We are working
on an entirely different trail now. You come on out, and
you can see our new apparatus. They are working on tremendous
voltages, and hoping to smash the thing by a brutal
bombardment of terrific voltage. We're trying, thanks to the
results of those instruments, to get results with small,
terrifically intense fields."</p>

<p>"How do you know that's their general system?"</p>

<p>"They left traces on the records of the post instruments.
These records show such intensities as we never got. They
have atomic energy, necessarily, and they might have had
material energy, actual destruction of matter, but apparently,
from the field readings it's the former. To be able to make
those tremendous hops, light-years in length, they needed
a real store of energy. They have accumulators, of course, but
I don't think they could store enough power by the system
they use to do it."</p>

<p>"Well, how's your trick 'bank' out on Luna, despite its
twelve-foot walls, going to stand an atomic explosion?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"More protective devices to come is our only hope. I'm
working on three trails: atomic energy, some type of magnetic
shield that will stop any moving material particle, and
their faster-than-light thing. Also, that fortress&mdash;I mean, of
course, bank&mdash;is going to have a lot of lead-lined rooms."</p>

<p>"I wish I could use the remaining money the Board gave
me to lead-line a lot of those IP ships," said McLaurin
wistfully. "Can't you make a gamma-ray bomb of some sort?"</p>

<p>"Not without their atomic energy release. With it, of
course, it's easy to flood a region with rays. It'll be a million
times worse than radium 'C,' which is bad enough."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll send through this petition for armaments. They'll
pass it all right, I think. They may get some kicks from old
Jacob Ezra Stubbs. Jacob Ezra doesn't believe in anything
war-like. I wish they'd find some way to keep him off of the
Arms Petition Board. He might just as well stay home
and let 'em vote his ticket uniformly 'nay.'" Buck Kendall
left with a laugh.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Buck Kendall had his troubles though. When he had
reached Earth again, he found that his properties totaled
one hundred and three million dollars, roughly. One doesn't
sell properties of that magnitude, one borrows against them.
But to all intents and purposes, Buck Kendall owned two
half-completed ship's hulls in the Baldwin Spaceship Yards,
a great deal of massive metal work on its way to Luna, and
contracts for some very extensive work on a "bank." Beyond
that, about eleven million was left.</p>

<p>A large portion of the money had been invested in a
laboratory, the like of which the world had never seen. It
was devoted exclusively to physics, and principally the physics
of destruction. Dr. Paul Devin was the Director, Cole
was in charge of the technical work, and Buck Kendall
was free to do all the work he thought needed doing.</p>

<p>Returned to his laboratory, he looked sourly at the bench
on which seven mechanicians were working. The ninth successive
experiment on the release of atomic energy had
failed. The tenth was in process of construction. A heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pure tungsten dome, three feet in diameter, three inches
thick, was being lowered over a clear insulum dome, a foot
smaller. Inside, the real apparatus was arranged around the
little pool of mercury. From it, two massive tungsten-copper
alloy conductors led through the insulum housing, and
outside. These, so Kendall had hoped, would surge with the
power of broken atoms, but he was beginning to believe
rather bitterly, they would never do so.</p>

<p>Buck went on to his offices, and the main calculator room.
There were ten calculator tables here, two of them in operation
now.</p>

<p>"Hello, Devin. Getting on?"</p>

<p>"No," said Devin bitterly, "I'm getting off. Look at these
results." He brought over a sheaf of graphs, with explanatory
tables attached. Rapidly Buck ran through them with him.
Most of them were graphs of functions of light, considered
as a wave in these experiments.</p>

<p>"H-m-m-m&mdash;not very encouraging. Looks like you've got
the field&mdash;but it just snaps shut on itself and won't work.
The lack of volume makes it break down, if you establish it,
and makes it impossible to establish in the first place without
the energy of matter. Not so hot. That's certainly cock-eyed
somewhere."</p>

<p>"I'm not. The math may be."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Kendall grinned&mdash;"it amounts to the same thing.
The point is, light doesn't. Let's run over that theory again.
Light is not only magnetic; but electric. Somehow it transforms
electric fields cyclically into magnetic fields and back
again. Now what we want to do is to transform an electric
into a magnetic field and have it stay there. That's the first
step. The second thing, is to have the lines of magnetic force
you develop, lie down like a sheath around the ship, instead
of standing out like the hairs on an angry cat, the
way they want to. That means turning them ninety degrees,
and turning an electric into a magnetic field means turning
the space-strain ninety degrees. Light evidently forms
a magnetic field whose lines of force reach along its direction
of motion, so that's your starting point."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and <i>that</i>," growled Devin, "seems to be the finishing
point. Quite definitely and clearly, the graph looped down
to zero. In other words, the field closed in on itself, and
destroyed itself."</p>

<p>"Light doesn't vanish."</p>

<p>"I'll make you all the lights you want."</p>

<p>"I simply mean there must be something that will stop it."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Transform it back to electric field before it
gets a chance to close in, then repeat the process&mdash;the
way light does."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't make such a good magnetic shield.
Every time that field started pulsing out through the walls
of the ship it would generate heat. We want a permanent
field that will stay on the job out there. I wonder if you
couldn't make a conductor device that would open that
field out&mdash;some special type of oscillating field that would
keep it open."</p>

<p>"H-m-m-m&mdash;that's an angle I might try. Any suggestions?"</p>

<p>Kendall had suggestions, and rapidly he outlined a development
that appeared from some of the earlier mathematics
on light, and might be what they wanted.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Kendall, however, had problems of his own to work on.
The question of atomic energy he was leaving alone, till
the present experiment either succeeded, or, as he rather
suspected, failed as had its predecessors. His present problem
was to develop more fully some interesting lines of research
he had run across in investigating mathematically the trick
of turning electric to magnetic fields and then turning
them back again. It might be that along this line he would
find the answer to the speed greater than that of light.
At any rate, he was interested.</p>

<p>He worked the rest of that day, and most of the next on
that line&mdash;till he ran it into the ground with a pair of equations
that ended with the expression: dx.dv=h/(4&#960;m). Then Kendall
looked at them for a long moment, then he sighed gently
and threw them into a file cabinet. Heisenberg's Uncertainty.
He'd reduced the thing to a form that simply told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
him it was beyond the limits of certainty and he ran it into
the normal, natural uncertainty inevitable in Nature.</p>

<p>Anyway he had real work to do now. The machine was
about ready for his attention. The mechanicians had finished
putting it in shape for demonstration and trial. He himself
would have to test it over the rest of the afternoon and
arrange for power and so forth.</p>

<p>By evening, when Commander McLaurin called around
with some of the other investors in Kendall's "bank" on Luna,
the thing was already started, warming up. The fields were
being fed and the various scientists of the group were watching
with interest. Power was flowing in already at a rate of
nearly one hundred thousand horsepower per minute, thanks
to a special line given them by New York Power (a Kendall
property). At ten o'clock they were beginning to expect the
reaction to start. By this time the fields weren't gaining in intensity
very rapidly, a maximum intensity had been reached
that should, they felt, break the atoms soon.</p>

<p>At eleven-thirty, through the little view window, Buck Kendall
saw something that made him cry out in amazement.
The mercury metal in the receiver, behind its layers
of screening was beginning to glow, with a dull reddish
light, and little solidifications were appearing in it! Eagerly
the men looked, as the solidifications spread slowly, like
crystals growing in an evaporating solution.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock came and went, and one o'clock and two
o'clock. Still the slow crystallization went on. Buck Kendall
was casting furtive glances at the kilowatt-hour meter. It
stood at a figure that represented twenty-seven thousand
dollars' worth of power. Long since the power rate had
been increased to the maximum available, as the power plant's
normal load reduced as the morning hours came. Surely,
this time something would start, but Buck had two worries.
If all the enormous amount of energy they had poured
in there decided to release itself at once&mdash;</p>

<p>And at any rate, Buck saw they'd never dare to let a
generator stop, once it was started!</p>

<p>The men were a tense group around the machine at three-fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="smcapl">A.M.</span> There remained only a tiny, dancing globule
of silvery mercury skittering around on the sharp, needle-like
crystals of the dull red metal that had resulted. Slowly that
skittering drop was shrinking&mdash;</p>

<p>Three twenty-two and a half <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span> saw the last fraction
of it vanish. Tensely the men stared into the machine&mdash;backing
off slowly&mdash;watching the meters on the board. At
nearly eighty thousand volts the power had been fed into
it.</p>

<p>The power continued to flow, and a growing halo of intense
violet light appeared suddenly on those red, needle-like
crystals, a swiftly expanding halo&mdash;</p>

<p>Without a sound, without the slightest disturbance, the
halo vanished, and softly, gently, the needle-like crystals relapsed,
melted away, and a dull pool of metallic mercury
rested in the receiver.</p>

<p>At eighty thousand volts, power was flowing in&mdash;</p>

<p>And it didn't even sparkle.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> apparatus of the magnetic shield had been completed
two days later, and set up in Buck's own laboratory. On the
bench was the powerful, but small, little projector of the
straight magnetic field, simply a specially designed accumulator,
a super-condenser, and the peculiar apparatus Devin
had designed to distort the electric field through ninety
degrees to a magnetic field. Behind this was a curious, paraboloid
projector made up of hundreds of tiny, carefully
orientated coils. This was Buck's own contribution. They were
ready for the tests.</p>

<p>"I would invite McLaurin in to see this," said Kendall looking
at them, and then across the room bitterly toward the
alleged atomic power apparatus on the opposite bench. "I
think it will work. But after <i>that</i>&mdash;" He stared, glaring, at the
heavy tungsten dome with its heavy tungsten contacts, across
which the flame of released atomic energy was supposed to
have leapt. "That was probably the flattest flop any experiment
ever flopped."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it didn't blow up. That's one comfort," suggested
Devin.</p>

<p>"I wish it had. Then at least it would have shown some
response. The only response shown, actually, was shown on
the power meter. It damn near wore out the bearings turning
so fast."</p>

<p>"Personally, I prefer the lack of action." Devin laughed.
"Have you got that circuit hooked up?"</p>

<p>"Right," sighed Kendall, turning back to the work in hand.
"Is Douglass in on this?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the next room. He'll let us know when he's
ready. He's setting up those instruments."</p>

<p>Douglass, a young junior physicist, late of the IP Physics
Department, stuck his head in the door and announced his
instruments were all set up.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on them. They'll move somehow, at any
rate. This thing couldn't go as flat as that atom-buster
of mine."</p>

<p>Carefully Kendall made a few last-minute adjustments on
the limiting relays, and took up his position at the power
board. Devin took his place near the apparatus, with another
series of instruments, similar to those Douglass was now
watching in the next room, some thirty feet away, through
the two-inch metal wall. "Ready," called Kendall.</p>

<p>The switch shot home. Instantly Kendall, Devin, and all
the men in the building jumped some six feet from their
former positions. A monstrous roar of sound crashed out in
that laboratory that thundered from one wall to the other,
and bellowed in a Titan's fury. It thundered and growled,
it bellowed and howled, the walls shook with the march
and counter-march of crashing waves of sound.</p>

<p>And a ten-foot wavering flame of blue-white, bellying
electric fire shuddered up to the ceiling from the contact
points of the alleged atomic generator. The heat, pouring
out from the flashing, roaring arc sent prickles of aching
burns over Kendall's skin. For ten seconds he stood in
utter, paralyzed surprise as his flop of flops bellowed its
anger at his disdain. Then he leapt to the power board and
shut off the roaring thing, by cutting the switch that had
started it.</p>

<p>"Spirits of Space! Did <i>that</i> come to life!"</p>

<p>"<i>Atomic Energy!</i>" Devin cried.</p>

<p>"Atomic energy, hell. That's my thirty thousand dollars'
worth of power breaking loose again," chortled Kendall. "We
missed the atomic energy, but, sweet boy, what an accumulator
we stubbed our toes on! I wondered where in blazes
all that power went to. That's the answer. I'll bet I can
tell you right now what happened. We built that mercury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
up to a new level, and that transitional stage was the red,
crystalline metal. When it reached the higher stage, it was
temporarily stable&mdash;but that projector over there that we
designed for the purpose of holding open electric and magnetic
fields just opened the door and let all that power right
out again."</p>

<p>"But why isn't it atomic energy? How do you know that
no more than your power that you put in is coming out?"
demanded Devin.</p>

<p>"The arc, man, the arc. That was a high-current, and
low-voltage arc. Couldn't you tell by the sound that no
great voltage&mdash;as atomic voltages go&mdash;was smashing across
there? If we were getting atomic voltage&mdash;and power&mdash;there'd
have been a different tone to it, high and shriller.</p>

<p>"Now, did you take any readings?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, man? I'm human. Do you think I
got any readings with that thing bellowing and shrieking in
my ears, and burning my skin with ultra-violet? It itches
now."</p>

<p>Kendall laughed. "You know what to do for an itch. Now,
I'm going to make a bet. We had those points separated for
a half-million volts discharge, but there was a dust-cover
thrown over them just now. That, you notice, is missing. I'll
bet that served as a starter lead for the main arc. Now
I'm going to start that projector thing again, and move the
points there through about six inches, and that thing probably
won't start itself."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Most of the laboratory staff had collected at the doorway,
looking in at the white-hot tungsten discharge points,
and the now silent "atomic engine." Kendall turned to them
and said: "The flop picked itself up. You go on back,
we seem to be all in one piece yet. Douglass, you didn't
get any readings, did you?"</p>

<p>Sheepishly, Douglass grinned at him. "Eh&mdash;er&mdash;no&mdash;but I
tore my pants. The magnetic field grabbed me and I jumped.
They had some steel buttons, and a lot of steel keys&mdash;they're
kinda' hard to keep on now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The laboratory staff broke into a roar of laughter, as
Douglass, holding up his trousers with both hands was beheld.</p>

<p>"I guess the field worked," he said.</p>

<p>"I guess maybe it did," adjudged Kendall solemnly. "We
have some rope here if you need it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Douglass returned to his post.</p>

<p>Swiftly, Kendall altered the atomic distortion storage apparatus,
and returned to the power-board. "Ready?"</p>

<p>"Check."</p>

<p>Kendall shoved home the switch. The storage device was
silent. Only a slight feeling of strain made itself felt, and
the sudden noisy hum of a small transformer nearby. "She
works, Buck!" Devin called. "The readings check almost exactly."</p>

<p>"All good then. Now I want to get to that atomic
thing. We can let that slide for a little bit&mdash;I'll answer it."</p>

<p>The telephone had rung noisily. "Kendall Labs&mdash;Kendall
speaking."</p>

<p>"This is Superintendent Foster, of the New York Power,
Mr. Kendall. We have some trouble just now that we think
your operations may be responsible for. The sub-station at
North Beaumont blew all the fuses, and threw the breakers
at the main station. The men out there said the transformers
began howling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right you are&mdash;I'm afraid I did do that. I had no idea
that it would reach so far. How far is that from my place
here?"</p>

<p>"It's about a thousand yards, according to the survey
maps."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;and I'll be careful about it. Any damage, I am
responsible for? All okay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Kendall."</p>

<p>Kendall hung up. "We stirred
up a lot more dust than we expected, Devin. Now let's
start seeing if we can keep track of it. Douglass, how did your
readings show?"</p>

<p>"I took them at the ten stations, and here they are. The
stations are two feet apart."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"H-m-m&mdash;.5&mdash;.55&mdash;.6&mdash;.7&mdash;20&mdash;198&mdash;5950&mdash;6010&mdash;6012&mdash;5920.
Very, very nice&mdash;only the darned thing's got an arm as
long as the law. Your readings were about .2, Devin?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Then these little readings are just leakage. What's our
normal intensity here?"</p>

<p>"About .19. Just a very small fraction less than the readings."</p>

<p>"Perfect&mdash;we have what amounts to a hollow shell of magnetic
force&mdash;we can move inside, and you can move outside&mdash;far
enough. But you can't get a conductor or a magnetic
field through it." He put the readings on the bench,
and looked at the apparatus across the room. "Now I want
to start right on that other. Douglass, you move that magnetostat
apparatus out of the way, and leave just the 'can-opener'
of ours&mdash;the projector. I'm pretty sure that's what does
the deed. Devin, see if you can hunt up some electrostatic
voltmeters with a range in the neighborhood of&mdash;I think
it'll be about eighty thousand."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Rapidly, Douglass was dismounting the apparatus, as Devin
started for the stock room. Kendall started making some
new connections, reconnecting the apparatus they had intended
using on the "atomic engine," largely high-capacity
resistances. He seemed to perform this work mechanically,
his mind definitely on something else. Suddenly he stopped,
and looked carefully into the receiver of the machine. The
metal in it was silvery, liquid, and here and there a floating
crystal of the dull red metal. Slowly a smile spread across
his face. He turned to Douglass.</p>

<p>"Douglass&mdash;ah, you're through. Get on the trail of MacBride,
and get him and his crew to work making half a
dozen smaller things like this. Tell 'em they can leave off the
tungsten shield. I want different metals in the receiver of
each. Use&mdash;hmmm&mdash;sodium&mdash;copper&mdash;magnesium&mdash;aluminium,
iron and chromium. Got it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." He left, just as Devin returned with a large
electrostatic voltmeter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like," said he, "to know how you know the voltage
will range around eighty thousand."</p>

<p>"K-ring excitation potential for mercury. I'm willing to
bet that thing simply shoved the whole electron system of
the mercury out a notch&mdash;that it simply <i>hasn't</i> any K-ring
of electrons now. I'm trying some other metals. Douglass
is going to have MacBride make up half a dozen more
machines. Machines&mdash;they need a name. This&mdash;ah&mdash;this is
an 'atostor.' MacBride's going to make up half a dozen of
'em, and try half a dozen metals. I'm almost certain that's
not mercury in there now, at all. It's probably element 99 or
something like it."</p>

<p>"It looks like mercury&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly. So would 99. Following the periodic table,
99 would probably have an even lower melting point than
mercury, be silvery, dense and heavy&mdash;and perhaps slightly
radioactive. The series under the B family of Group II is
Magnesium, Zinc, Cadmium, Mercury&mdash;and 99. The melting
point is going down all the way, and they're all silvery metals.
I'm going to try copper, and I fully expect it to turn
silvery&mdash;in fact, to become silver."</p>

<p>"Then let's see." Swiftly they hooked up the apparatus,
realigned the projector, and again Kendall took his place
at the power-board. As he closed the switch, on no-load,
the electrostatic voltmeter flopped over instantly, and steadied
at just over 80,000 volts.</p>

<p>"I hate to say 'I told you so,'" said Kendall. "But let's hook
in a load. Try it on about 100 amps first."</p>

<p>Devin began cutting in load. The resistors began heating
up swiftly as more and more current flowed through them.
By not so much as by a vibration of the voltmeter needle,
did the apparatus betray any strain as the load mounted
swiftly. 100&mdash;200&mdash;500&mdash;1000 amperes. Still, that needle held
steady. Finally, with a drain of ten thousand amperes, all
the equipment available could handle, the needle was steady
as a rock, though the tremendous load of 800,000,000 watts
was cut in and out. That, to atoms, atoms by the nonillions,
was no appreciable load at all. There was <i>no</i> internal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
resistance whatever. The perfect accumulator had certainly
been discovered.</p>

<p>"I'll have to call McLaurin&mdash;" Kendall hurried away with
a broad, broad smile.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Hello, Tom?"</span></p>

<p>The telephone rattled in a peeved sort of way. "Yes, it
is. What now? And when am I going to see you in a social
sort of way again?"</p>

<p>"Not for a long, long time; I'm busy. I'm busy right now
as a matter of fact. I'm calling up the vice-president of
Faragaut Interplanetary Lines, and I want to place an order."</p>

<p>"Why bother me? We have clerks, you know, for that
sort of thing," suggested Faragaut in a pained voice.</p>

<p>"Tom, do you know how much I'm worth now?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied Faragaut promptly. "What of it? I
hear, as a matter of fact that you're worth even less in a
business way. They're talking quite a lot down this way about
an alleged bank you're setting up on Luna. I hear it's
got more protective devices, and armor than any IP station
in the System, that you even had it designed by an
IP designer, and have a gang of Colonels and Generals in
charge. I also hear that you've succeeded in getting rid of
money at about one million dollars a day&mdash;just slightly shy
of that."</p>

<p>"You overestimate me, my friend. Much of that is merely
contracted for. Actually it'll take me nearly nine months to
get rid of it. And by that time I'll have more. Anyway, I
think I have something like ten million left. And remember
that way back in the twentieth century some old fellow
beat my record. Armour, I think it was, lost a million dollars
a day for a couple of months running.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyway, what I called you up for was to say I'd like
to order five hundred thousand tons of mercury, for delivery
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"What! Oh, say, I thought you were going in for business."
Faragaut gave a slight laugh of relief.</p>

<p>"Tom, I am. I mean exactly what I say. I want five&mdash;hundred&mdash;thousand&mdash;<i>tons</i>
of metallic mercury, and just as
soon as you can get it."</p>

<p>"Man, there isn't that much in the system."</p>

<p>"I know it. Get all there is on the market for me, and contract
to take all the 'Jupiter Heavy-Metals' can turn out. You
send those orders through, and clean out the market completely.
Somebody's about to pay for the work I've been doing,
and boy, they're going to pay through the nose. After
you've got that order launched, and don't make a christening
party of the launching either, why just drop out here, and I'll
show you why the value of mercury is going so high you
won't be able to follow it in a space ship."</p>

<p>"The cost of that," said Faragaut, seriously now, "will be
about&mdash;fifty-three million at the market price. You'd have
to put up twenty-six cash, and I don't believe you've got it."</p>

<p>Buck laughed. "Tom, loan me a dozen million, will you?
You send that order through, and then come see what I've
got. I've got a break, too! Mercury's the best metal for this
use&mdash;and it'll stop gamma rays too!"</p>

<p>"So it will&mdash;but for the love of the system, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Come and see&mdash;tonight. Will you send that order through?"</p>

<p>"I will, Buck. I hope you're right. Cash is tight now,
and I'll probably have to put up nearer twenty million,
when all that buying goes through. How long will it be tied
up in that deal, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Not over three weeks. And I'll guarantee you three
hundred percent&mdash;if you'll stay in with me after you start.
Otherwise&mdash;I don't think making this money would be fair
just now."</p>

<p>"I'll be out to see you in about two hours, Buck. Where
are you? At the estate?" asked Faragaut seriously.</p>

<p>"In my lab out there. Thanks, Tom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>McLaurin was there when Tom Faragaut arrived. And
General Logan, and Colonel Gerardhi. There was a restrained
air of gratefulness about all of them that Tom Faragaut
couldn't quite understand. He had been looking up Buck
Kendall's famous bank, and more and more he had begun
to wonder just what was up. The list of stockholders had
read like a list of IP heroes and executives. The staff had
been a list of IP men with a slender sprinkling of accountants.
And the sixty-million dollar structure was to be a bank without
advertising of any sort! Usually such a venture is planned
and published months in advance. This had sprung up suddenly,
with a strange quietness.</p>

<p>Almost silently, Buck Kendall led the way to the laboratory.
A small metal tank was supported in a peculiar piece
of apparatus, and from it led a small platinum pipe to a
domed apparatus made largely of insulum. A little pool of
mercury, with small red crystals floating in it rested in a
shallow hollow surrounded by heavy conductors.</p>

<p>"That's it, Tom. I wanted to show you first what we have,
and why I wanted all that mercury. Within three weeks,
every man, woman and child in the system will be clamoring
for mercury metal. That's the perfect accumulator." Quickly
he demonstrated the machine, charging it, and then discharging
it. It was better than 99.95% efficient on the charge,
and was 100% efficient on the discharge.</p>

<p>"Physically, any metal will do. Technically, mercury is
best for a number of reasons. It's a liquid. I can, and do it in
this, charge a certain quantity, and then move it up to the
storage tank. Charge another pool, and move it up. In discharge,
I can let a stream flow in continuously if I required
a steady, terrific drain of power without interruption. If I
wanted it for more normal service, I'd discharge a pool,
drain it, refill the receiver, and discharge a second pool.
Thus, mercury is the metal to use.</p>

<p>"Do you see why I wanted all that metal?"</p>

<p>"I do, Buck&mdash;Lord, I do," gasped Faragaut. "That is the
perfect power supply."</p>

<p>"No, confound it, it isn't. It's a secondary source. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
isn't primary. We're just as limited in the <i>supply</i> of power
as ever&mdash;only we have increased our distribution of power.
Lord knows, we're going to need a power <i>supply</i> badly
enough before long&mdash;" Buck relapsed into moody silence.</p>

<p>"What," asked Faragaut, looking around him, "does that
mean?"</p>

<p>It was McLaurin who told him of the stranger ship, and
Kendall's interpretation of its meaning. Slowly Faragaut
grasped the meaning behind Buck's strange actions of the
past months.</p>

<p>"The Lunar Bank," he said slowly, half to himself. "Staffed
by trained IP men, experts in expert destruction. Buck, you
said something about the profits of this venture. What did
you mean?"</p>

<p>Buck smiled. "We're going to stick up IP to the extent
necessary to pay for that fort&mdash;er&mdash;bank&mdash;on Luna. We'll
also boost the price so that we'll make enough to pay for
those ships I'm having made. The public will pay for that."</p>

<p>"I see. And we aren't to stick the price too high, and just
make money?"</p>

<p>"That's the general idea."</p>

<p>"The IP Appropriations Board won't give you what you
need, Commander, for real improvements on the IP ships?"</p>

<p>"They won't believe Kendall. Therefore they won't."</p>

<p>"What did you mean about gamma rays, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Mercury will stop them and the Commander here intends
to have the refitted ships built so that the engine room
and control room are one, and completely surrounded by
the mercury tanks. The men will be protected against the
gamma rays."</p>

<p>"Won't the rays affect the power stored in the mercury&mdash;perhaps
release it?"</p>

<p>"We tried it out, of course, and while we can't get the
intensities we expect, and can't really make any measurements
of the gamma-ray energy impinging on the mercury&mdash;it
seems to absorb, and store that energy!"</p>

<p>"What's next on the program, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Finish those ships I have building. And I want to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some more development work. The Stranger will return
within six months now, I believe. It will take all that time,
and more for real refitting of the IP ships."</p>

<p>"How about more forts&mdash;or banks, whichever you want
to call them. Mars isn't protected."</p>

<p>"Mars is abandoned," replied General Logan seriously.
"We haven't any too much to protect old Earth, and she
must come first. Mars will, of course, be protected as best
the IP ships can. But&mdash;we're expecting defeat. This isn't a
case of glorious victory. It will be a case of hard won survival.
We don't know anything about the enemy&mdash;except that
they are capable of interstellar flights, and have atomic
energy. They are evidently far ahead of us. Our battle is to
survive till we learn how to conquer. For a time, at
least, the Strangers will have possession of most of the planets
of the system. We do not think they will be able to reach
Earth, because Commander McLaurin here will withdraw
his ships to Earth to protect the planet&mdash;and the great 'Lunar
Bank' will display its true character."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faragaut</span> looked unsympathetically at Buck Kendall, as he
stood glaring perplexedly at the apparatus he had been
working on.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Buck, won't she perk?"</p>

<p>"No, damn it, and it should."</p>

<p>"That," pointed out Faragaut, "is just what you think.
Nature thinks otherwise. We generally have to abide by her
opinions. What is it&mdash;or what is it meant to be?"</p>

<p>"Perfect reflector."</p>

<p>"Make a nice mirror. What else, and how come?"</p>

<p>"A mirror is just what I want. I want something that will
reflect <i>all</i> the radiation that falls on it. No metal will, even
in its range of maximum reflectivity. Aluminum goes pretty
high, silver, on some ranges, a bit higher. But none of
them reaches 99%. I want a perfect reflector that I can
put behind a source of wild, radiant energy so I can focus
it, and put it where it will do the most good."</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine percent. Sounds pretty good. That's better
efficiency than most anything else we have, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. The accumulator is 100% efficient on the
discharge, and a good transformer, even before that, ran
as high as 99.8 sometimes. They had to. If you have a
transformer handling 1,000,000 horsepower, and it's even
1% inefficient, you have a heat loss of nearly 10,000 horsepower
to handle. I want to use this as a destructive weapon,
and if I hand the other fellow energy in distressing amounts,
it's even worse at my end, because no matter how perfect
a beam I work out, there will still be some spread. I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
make it mighty tight though, if I make my surface a perfect
parabola. But if I send a million horse, I have to handle
it, and a ship can't stand several hundred thousand horsepower
roaming around loose as heat, let alone the weapon
itself. The thing will be worse to me than to him.</p>

<p>"I figured there was something worth investigating in
those fields we developed on our magnetic shield work. They
had to do, you know, with light, and radiant energy. There
must be some reason why a metal reflects. Further, though
we can't get down to the basic root of matter, the atom,
yet, we can play around just about as we please with molecules
and molecular forces. But it is molecular force that determines
whether light and radiant energy of that caliber
shall be reflected or transmitted. Take aluminum as an example.
In the metallic molecule state, the metal will reflect
pretty well. But volatilize it, and it becomes transparent. All
gases are transparent, all metals reflective. Then the secret
of perfect reflection lies at a molecular level in the organization
of matter, and is within our reach. Well&mdash;this thing
was supposed to make that piece of silver reflective. I missed
it that time." He sighed. "I suppose I'll have to try
again."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd use tungsten for that. If you do
have a slight leak, that would handle the heat."</p>

<p>"No, it would hold it. Silver is a better conductor of heat.
But the darned thing won't work."</p>

<p>"Your other scheme has." Faragaut laughed. "I came out
principally for some signatures. IP wants one hundred thousand
tons of mercury. I've sold most of mine already in the
open market. You want to sell?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And I told you my price."</p>

<p>"I know," sighed Faragaut. "It seems a shame though.
Those IP board men would pay higher. And they're so damn
tight it seems a crime not to make 'em pay up when they
have to."</p>

<p>"The IP will need the money worse elsewhere. Where do
I&mdash;oh, here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right. I'll be out again this evening. The regular group
will be here?"</p>

<p>Kendall nodded as he signed in triplicate.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>That evening, Buck had found the trouble in his apparatus,
for as he well knew, the theory was right, only the
practical apparatus needed changing. Before the group
composed of Faragaut, McLaurin and the members of Kendall's
"bank," he demonstrated it.</p>

<p>It was merely a small, model apparatus, with a mirror of
space-strained silver that was an absolutely perfect reflector.
The mirror had been ground out of a block of silver one
foot deep, by four inches square, carefully annealed, and
the work had all been done in a cooling bath. The result
was a mirror that was so nearly a perfect paraboloid that the
beam held sharp and absolutely tight for the half-mile range
they tested it on. At the projector it was three and one-half
inches in diameter. At the target, it was three and fifty-two
one hundredths inches in diameter.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got the mirror, what are you going to reflect
with it now?" asked McLaurin. "The greatest problem
is getting a radiant source, isn't it? You can't get a temperature
above about ten thousand degrees, and maintain it very
long, can you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Kendall smiled.</p>

<p>"It'll volatilize and leave the scene of action, won't it?"</p>

<p>"What if it's a gaseous source already?"</p>

<p>"What? Just a gas-flame? That won't give you the point
source you need. You're using just a spotlight here, with a
Moregan Point-light. That won't give you energy, and if
you use a gas-flame, the spread will be so great, that no
matter how perfectly you figure your mirror, it won't beam."</p>

<p>"The answer is easy. Not an ordinary gas-flame&mdash;a very
extra-special kind of gas-flame. Know anything about Renwright's
ionization-work?"</p>

<p>"Renwright&mdash;he's an IP man isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Right. He's developed a system, which, thanks to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
power we can get in that atostor, will sextuply ionize oxygen
gas. Now: what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"Spirits of space! Concentrated essence of energy!"</p>

<p>"Right. And in preparation, Cole here had one made up
for me. That&mdash;and something else. We'll just hook it up&mdash;"</p>

<p>With Devin's aid, Kendall attached the second apparatus,
a larger device into which the silver block with its mirror
surface fitted. With the uttermost care, the two physicists lined
it up. Two projectors pointed toward each other at an angle,
the base angles of a triangle, whose apex was the center
of the mirror. On very low power, a soft, glowing violet light
filtered out through the opening of the one, and a slight green
light came from the other. But where the two streams met,
an intense, violet glare built up. The center of action was
not at the focus, and slowly this was lined up, till a sharp,
violet beam of light reached out across the open yard to the
target set up.</p>

<p>Buck Kendall cut off the power, and slowly got into position.
"Now. Keep out from in front of that thing. Put on
these glasses&mdash;and watch out." Heavy, thick-lensed orange-brown
goggles were passed out, and Kendall took his place.
Before him, a thick window of the same glass had been arranged,
so that he might see uninterruptedly the controls
at hand, and yet watch unblinded, the action of the beam.</p>

<p>Dully the mirror-force relay clicked. A hazy glow ran
over the silver block, and died. Then&mdash;simultaneously the
power was thrown from two small, compact atostors into
the twin projectors. Instantly&mdash;a titanic eruption of light
almost invisibly violet, spurted out in a solid, compact stream.
With a roar and crash, it battered its way through the thick
air, and crashed into the heavy target plate. A stream of
flame and scintillating sparks erupted from the armor plate&mdash;and
died as Kendall cut the beam. A white-hot area a
foot across leaked down the face of the metal.</p>

<p>"That," said Faragaut gently, removing his goggles. "That's
not a spotlight, and it's not exactly a gas-flame. But I still
don't know what that blue-hot needle of destruction is.
Just what do you call that tame stellar furnace of yours?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so far off, Tom," said Kendall happily, "except that
even S Doradus is cold compared to that. That sends almost
pure ultra-violet light&mdash;which, by the way, it is almost
impossible to reflect successfully, and represents a temperature
to be expressed not in thousands of degrees, nor
yet in tens of thousands. I calculated the temperature would
be about 750,000 degrees. What is happening is that a
stream of low-voltage electrons&mdash;cathode rays&mdash;in great quantity
are meeting great quantities of sextuply ionized oxygen.
That means that a nucleus used to having two electrons in the
K-ring, and six in the next, has had that outer six knocked
off, and then has been hurled violently into free air.</p>

<p>"All by themselves, those sextuply ionized oxygen atoms
would have a good bit to say, but they don't really begin
to talk till they start roaring for those electrons I'm feeding
them. At the meeting point, they grab up all they can get&mdash;probably
about five&mdash;before the competition and the fierce
release of energy drives them out, part-satisfied. I lose a little
energy there, but not a real fraction. It's the howl they put
up for the first four that counts. The electron-feed is necessary,
because otherwise they'd smash on and ruin that mirror.
They work practically in a perfect vacuum. That beam
smashes the air out of the way. Of course, in space it would
work better."</p>

<p>"How could it?" asked Faragaut, faintly.</p>

<p>"Kendall," asked McLaurin, "can we install that in the IP
ships?"</p>

<p>"You can start." Kendall shrugged. "There isn't a lot of
apparatus. I'm going to install them in my ships, and in the&mdash;bank.
I suspect&mdash;we haven't a lot of time left."</p>

<p>"How near ready are those ships?"</p>

<p>"About. That's all I can say. They've been torn up a bit
for installation of the atostor apparatus. Now they'll have
to be changed again."</p>

<p>"Anything more coming?"</p>

<p>Buck smiled slowly. He turned directly to McLaurin and
replied: "Yes&mdash;the Strangers. As to developments&mdash;I can't
tell, naturally. But if they do, it will be something entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
unexpected now. You see, given one new discovery, a half-dozen
will follow immediately from it. When we announced
that atostor, look what happened. Renwright must have
thought it was God's gift to suffering physicists. He stuck
some oxygen in the thing, added some of his own stuff&mdash;and
behold. The magnetic apparatus gave us directly the
shield, and indirectly this mirror. Now, I seem to have reached
the end for the time. I'm still trying to get that space-release
for high speed&mdash;speed greater than light, that is. So
far," he added bitterly, "all I've gotten as an answer is a
single expression that simply means practical zero&mdash;Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Expression."</p>

<p>"I'm uncertain as to your meaning"&mdash;McLaurin smiled&mdash;"but
I take it that's nothing new."</p>

<p>"No. Nearly four centuries old&mdash;twentieth century physics.
I'll have to try some other line of attack, I guess, but
that did seem so darned right. It just sounded right. Something
ought to happen&mdash;and it just keeps saying 'nothing
more except the natural uncertainty of nature.'"</p>

<p>"Try it out, your math might be wrong somewhere."</p>

<p>Kendall laughed. "If it was&mdash;I'd hate to try it out. If it
wasn't I'd have no reason to. And there's plenty of other
work to do. For one thing, getting that apparatus in production.
The IP board won't like me." Kendall smiled.</p>

<p>"They don't," replied McLaurin. "They're getting more
and more and more worried&mdash;but they've got to keep the
IP fleet in such condition that it can at least catch an up-to-date
freighter."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Gresth Gkae looked back at Sthor rapidly dropping behind,
and across at her sister world, Asthor, circling a bare
100,000 miles away. Behind his great interstellar cruiser
came a long line of similar ships. Each was loaded now
not with instruments and pure scientists, but with weapons,
fuel and warriors. Colonists too, came in the last ships. One
hundred and fifty giant ships. All the wealth of Sthor and
Asthor had been concentrated in producing those great
machines. Every one represented nearly the equivalent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
thirty million Earth-dollars. Four and a half billions of dollars
for mere materials.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae had the honor of lead position, for he had
discovered the planets and their stable, though tiny, sun.
Still, Gresth Gkae knew his own giant Mira was a super-giant
sun&mdash;and a curse and a menace to any rational society.
Our yellow-white sun (to his eyes, an almost invisible
color, similar to our blue) was small, but stable, and warm
enough.</p>

<p>In half an hour, all the ships were in space, and at a
given signal, at ten-second intervals, they sprang into the
superspeed, faster than light. For an instant, giant Mira ran
and seemed distorted, as though seen through a porthole
covered with running water, then steadied, curiously distorted.
Faster than light they raced across the galaxy.</p>

<p>Even in their super-fast ships, nearly three and a half
weeks passed before the sun they sought, singled itself from
the star-field as an extra bright point. Two days more, and
the sun was within planetary distance. They came at an
angle to the plane of the ecliptic, but they leveled down to
it now, and slanted toward giant Jupiter and Jovian worlds.
Ten worlds, in one sweep, it was&mdash;four habitable worlds.
The nine satellites would be converted into forts at once,
nine space-sweeping forts guarding the approaches to the
planet. Gresth Gkae had made a fairly good search of the
worlds, and knew that Earth was the main home of civilization
in this system. Mars was second, and Venus third. But
Jupiter offered the greatest possibilities for quick settlement,
a base from which they could more easily operate, a
base for fuels, for the heavy elements they would need&mdash;</p>

<p>Fifteen million miles from Jupiter they slowed below the
speed of light&mdash;and the IP stations observed them. Instantly,
according to instructions issued by Commander McLaurin,
a fleet of ten of the tiniest, fastest scouts darted out. As
soon as possible, a group of three heavy cruisers, armed
with all the inventions that had been discovered, the atostor
power system, perfectly conducting power leads, the
terrible UV ray, started out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The scouts got there first. Cameras were grinding steadily,
with long range telescopic lenses, delicate instruments
probed and felt and caught their fingers in the fields of
the giant fleet.</p>

<p>At ten-second intervals, giant ships popped into being, and
glided smoothly toward Jupiter.</p>

<p>Then the cruisers arrived. They halted at a respectful distance,
and waited. The Miran ships plowed on undisturbed.
Simultaneously, from the three leaders, terrific neutron rays
shot out. The paraffin block walls stopped those&mdash;and the
cruisers started to explain their feelings on the subject. They
were the IP-J-37, 39, and 42. The 37 turned up the full
power of the UV ray. The terrific beam of ultra-violet energy
struck the second Miran ship, and the spot it touched
exploded into incandescence, burned white-hot&mdash;and puffed
out abruptly as the air pressure within blew the molten
metal away.</p>

<p>The Mirans were startled. This was not the type of thing
Gresth Gkae had warned them of. Gresth Gkae himself
frowned as the sudden roar of the machines of his ship
rose in the metal walls. A stream of ten-inch atomic bombs
shrieked out of their tubes, fully glowing green things floated
out more slowly, and immediately waxed brilliant. Gamma
ray bombs&mdash;but they could be guarded against&mdash;</p>

<p>The three Solarian cruisers were washed in such frightful
flame as they had never imagined. Streams of atomic bombs
were exploding soundlessly, ineffectively in space, not thirty
feet from them as they felt the sudden resistance of the
magnetic shields. Hopefully, the 39 probed with her neutron
gun. Nothing happened save that several gamma ray
bombs went off explosively, and all the atomic bombs in its
path exploded at once.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae knew what that meant. Neutron beam guns.
Then this race was more intelligent than he had believed.
They had not had them before. Had he perhaps given them
too much warning and information?</p>

<p>There was a sudden, deeper note in the thrumming roar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the great ship. Eagerly Gresth Gkae watched&mdash;and sighed
in relief. The nearer of the three enemy ships was crumbling
to dust. Now the other two were beginning to become blurred
of outline. They were fleeing&mdash;but oh, so slowly. Easily the
greater ship chased them down, till only floating dust, and a
few small pieces of&mdash;</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae shrieked in pain, and horror. The destroyed
ships had fought in dying. All space seemed to blossom out
with a terrible light, a light that wrapped around them,
and burned into him, and through him. His eyes were dark
and burning lumps in his head, his flesh seemed crawling,
stinging&mdash;he was being flayed alive&mdash;in shrieking agony he
crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p>Hospital attach&eacute;s came to him, and injected drugs. Slowly
torturing consciousness left him. The doctors began working
over his horribly burned body, shuddering inwardly as
the protective, feather-like covering of his skin loosened, and
dropped from his body. Tenderly they lowered him into
a bath of chemicals&mdash;</p>

<p>"The terrible light which caused so much damage to our
men," reported a physicist, "was analyzed, and found to
have some extraordinary lines. It was largely mercury-vapor
spectrum, but the spectrum of mercury-atoms in an
impossibly strained condition. I would suggest that great
care be used hereafter, and all men be equipped with protective
masks when observations are needed. This sun is
very rich in the infra-X-rays and ultra-visible light. The
explosion of light, we witnessed, was dangerous in its consisting
almost wholly of very short and hard infra-X-rays."</p>

<p>The physicist had a special term for what we know as
ultra-violet light. To him, blue was ultra-violet, and exceedingly
dangerous to red-sensitive eyes. To him, our ultra-violet
was a long X-ray, and was designated by a special
term. And to him&mdash;the explosion of the atostor reservoirs
was a terrible and mystifying calamity.</p>

<p>To the men in the five tiny scout-ships, it was also a
surprise, and a painful one. Even space-hardened humans
were burned by the terrifically hard ultra-violet from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
explosion. But they got some hint of what it had meant
to the Mirans from the confusion that resulted in the fleet.
Several of the nearer ships spun, twisted, and went erratically
off their courses. All seemed uncontrolled momentarily.</p>

<p>The five scouts, following orders, darted instantly toward
the Lunar Bank. Why, they did not know. But those were
orders. They were to land there.</p>

<p>The reason was that, faster than any Solarian ship, radio
signals had reached McLaurin, and he, and most of the
staff of the IP service had been moved to the Lunar Bank.
Buck Kendall had extended an invitation in this "unexpected
emergency." It so happened that Buck Kendall's invitation
got there before any description of the Strangers, or their actions
had arrived. The staff was somewhat puzzled as to how
this happened&mdash;</p>

<p>And now for the satellites of great Jupiter.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty giant interstellar cruisers advanced
on Callisto. They didn't pause to investigate the mines and
scattered farms of the satellite, but ten great ships settled,
and a horde of warriors began pouring out.</p>

<p>One hundred and forty ships reached Ganymede. One
hundred and thirty sailed on. One hundred and thirty
ships reached Europa&mdash;and they sailed on hurriedly, one
hundred and twenty-nine of them. Gresth Gkae did not know
it then, but the fleet had lost its first ship. The IP station on
Europa had spoken back.</p>

<p>They sailed in, a mighty armada, and the first dropped
through Europa's thin, frozen atmosphere. They spotted the
dome of the station, and a neutron ray lashed out at it.
On the other, undefended worlds, this had been effective.
Here&mdash;it was answered by ten five-foot UV rays. Further,
these men had learned something from the destruction of
the cruisers, and ten torpedoes had been unloaded, reloaded
with atostor mercury, and sent out bravely.</p>

<p>Easily the Mirans wiped out the first torpedo&mdash;</p>

<p>Shrieking, the Miran pilots clawed their way from the controls
as the fearful flood of ultra-violet light struck their unaccustomed
skins. Others too felt that burning flood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The second torpedo they caught and deflected on a
beam of alternating-current magnetism that repelled it. It
did not come nearer than half a mile to the ship. The third
they turned their deflecting beam on&mdash;and something went
strangely wrong with the beam. It pulled that torpedo toward
the ship with a sickening acceleration&mdash;and the torpedo
exploded in that frightful violet flame.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Five-foot diameter UV beams are nothing to play with.
The Mirans were dodging these now as they loosed atomic
bombs, only to see them exploded harmlessly by neutron
guns, or caught in the magnetic screen. Gamma ray bombs
were as useless. Again the beam of disintegrating force
was turned on&mdash;</p>

<p>The present opponent was not a ship. It was an IP defense
station, equipped with everything Solarian science
knew, and the dome was an eight-foot wall of tungsten-beryllium.
The eight feet of solid, ultra-resistant alloy drank
up that crumbling beam, and liked it. The wall did not fail.
The men inside the fort jerked and quivered as the strange
beam, a small, small fraction of it, penetrated the eight feet
of outer wall, the six feet or so of intervening walls, and
the mercury atostor reserves.</p>

<p>"Concentrate all those UV beams on one spot, and see
if you can blast a hole in him before he shakes it loose,"
ordered the ray technician. "He'll wiggle if you start off
with the beam. Train your sights on the nose of that first
ship&mdash;when you're ready, call out."</p>

<p>"Ready&mdash;ready&mdash;" Ten men replied. "Fire!" roared the
technician. Ten titanic swords of pure ultra-violet energy,
energy that practically no unconditioned metal will reflect to
more than fifty per cent, emerged. There was a single spot of
intense incandescence for a single hundredth of a second&mdash;and
then the energy was burning its way through the inner,
thinner skins with such rapidity that they sputtered and
flickered like a broken televisor.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-nine ships retreated hastily
for conference, leaving a gutted, wrecked hull, broken by its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fall, on Europa. Triumphantly, the Europa IP station hurled
out its radio message of the first encounter between a fort
and the Miran forces.</p>

<p>Most important of all, it sent a great deal of badly wanted
information regarding the Miran weapons. Particularly interesting
was the fact that it had withstood the impact of
that disintegrating ray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimly</span> Buck Kendall looked at the reports. McLaurin stood
beside him, Devin sat across the table from him. "What do
you make of it, Buck?" asked the Commander.</p>

<p>"That we have just one island of resistance left on the
Jovian worlds. And that will, I fear, vanish. They haven't
finished with their arsenal by any means."</p>

<p>"But what was it, man, what was it that ruined those ships?"</p>

<p>"Vibration. Somehow&mdash;Lord only knows how it's done&mdash;they
can project electric fields. These projected fields are oscillated,
and they are tuned in with some parts of the ship.
I suspect they are crystals of the metals. If they can start
a vibration in the crystals of the metal&mdash;that's fatigue, metal
fatigue enormously speeded. You know how a quartz crystal
oscillator in a radio-control apparatus will break, if you
work it on a very heavy load at the peak? They simply smash
the crystals of metal in the same way. Only they project
their field."</p>

<p>"Then our toughest metals are useless? Can't something
tough, rather than hard, like copper or even silver for instance,
stand it?"</p>

<p>"Calcium metal's the toughest going&mdash;and even that
would break under the beating those ships give it. The only
way to withstand it is to have such a mass of metal that the
oscillations are damped out. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>The set tuned in on the IP station on Europa was
speaking again. "The ships are returning. There are one
hundred and twenty-nine by accurate count. Jorgsen reports
that telescopic observation of the dead on the fallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cruiser show them to be a <i>completely un-human race</i>! They
are of mottled coloring, predominately grayish brown. The
ships are returning. They have divided into ten groups, nine
groups of two each, and a main body of the rest of the fleet.
The group of eighteen is descending within range, and we
are focusing our beams on them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Out by Europa, ten great UV beams were stabbing angrily
toward ten great interstellar ships. The metal of the
hulls glowed brilliant, and distorted slowly as the thick walls
softened under the heat, and the air behind pressed against
it. Grimly the ten ships came on. Torpedoes were being
launched, and exploded, and now they had no effect, for
the Mirans within were protected.</p>

<p>The eighteen grouped ships separated, and arranged themselves
in a circle around the fort. Suddenly one staggered
as a great puff of gas shot out through the thin atmosphere
of Europa to flare brilliantly in the lash of the stabbing UV
beam. Instantly the ship righted itself, and labored upward.
Another dropped to take its place&mdash;</p>

<p>And the great walls of the IP fort suddenly groaned and
started in their welded joints. The faint, whispering rustle of
the crumbling beam was murmuring through the station. Engineers
shouted suddenly as meters leapt the length of their
scales, and the needles clicked softly on the stop pins. A thin
rustle came from the atostors grouped in the great power
room. "Spirits of Space&mdash;a revolving magnetic field!" roared
the Chief Technician. "They're making this whole blasted
station a squirrel cage!"</p>

<p>The mighty walls of eight-foot metal shuddered and trembled.
The UV beams lashed out from the fort in quivering
arcs now, they did not hold their aim steady, and the magnetic
shield that protected them from atomic bombs was
working and straining wildly. Eighteen great ships quivered
and tugged outside there now, straining with all their power
to remain in the same spot, as they passed on from one to
another the magnetic impulses that were now creating a titanic
magnetic vortex about the fort.</p>

<p>"The atostors will be exhausted in another fifteen minutes,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Chief Technician roared into his transmitter. "Can
the signals get through those fields, Commander?"</p>

<p>"No, Mac. They've been stopped, Sparks tells me. We're
here&mdash;and let's hope we stay. What's happening?"</p>

<p>"They've got a revolving magnetic field out there that would
spin a minor planet. The whole blasted fort is acting like
the squirrel cage in an induction motor! They've made us the
armature in a five hundred million horsepower electric motor."</p>

<p>"They can't tear this place loose, can they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;it was never&mdash;" The Chief stopped. Outside
a terrific roar and crash had built up. White darts
of flame leapt a thousand feet into the air, hurling terrific
masses of shattered rock and soil.</p>

<p>"I was going to say," the Chief went on, "this place wasn't
designed for that sort of a strain. Our own magnetic field is
supporting us now, preventing their magnetic field from
getting its teeth on metal. When the strain comes&mdash;well,
they're cutting loose our foundation with atomic bombs!"</p>

<p>Five UV beams were combined on one interstellar ship.
Instantly the great machine retreated, and another dropped
in to take its place while the magnetic field spun on, uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>"Can they keep that up long?"</p>

<p>"God knows&mdash;but they have a hundred and more ships
to send in when the power of one gives out, remember."</p>

<p>"What's our reserve now?"</p>

<p>The Chief paused a moment to look at the meters. "Half
what it was ten minutes ago!"</p>

<p>Commander Wallace sent some other orders. Every torpedo
tube of the station suddenly belched forth deadly, fifteen-foot
torpedoes, most of them mud-torpedoes, torpedoes
loaded with high explosive in the nose, a delayed fuse,
and a load of soft clinging mud in the rear. The mud would
flow down over the nose and offer a resistance foot-hold for
the explosive which empty space would not. Four hundred
and three torpedoes, equipped with anti-magnetic apparatus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
darted out. One hundred and four passed the struggling
fields. One found lodgement on a Miran ship, and crushed
in a metal wall, to be stopped by a bulkhead.</p>

<p>The Chief engineer watched his power declining. All ten
UV beams were united in one now, driving a terrible
sword of energy that made the attacked ship skip for safety
instantly, yet the beams were all but useless. For the Miran
reserves filled the gap, and the magnetic tornado continued.</p>

<p>For seventeen long minutes the station resisted the attack.
Then the last of the strained mercury flowed into the
receivers, and the vast power of the atostors was exhausted.
Slowly the magnetic fields declined. The great walls of the
station felt the clutching lines of force&mdash;they began to heat
and to strain. A low, harsh grinding became audible over the
roar of the atomic bombs. The whole structure trembled, and
jumped slightly. The roar of bombs ceased suddenly, as the
station jerked again, more violently. Then it turned a bit,
rolled clumsily. Abruptly it began to spin violently, more
and more rapidly. It started rolling clumsily across the plateau&mdash;</p>

<p>A rain of atomic bombs struck the unprotected metal, and
the eighth breached the walls. The twentieth was the
last. There was no longer an IP station on Europa.</p>

<p>"The difference," said Buck Kendall slowly, when the reports
came in from scout-ships in space that had witnessed
the last struggle, "between an atomic generator and an
atomic power-store, or accumulator, is clearly shown. We
haven't an adequate <i>source</i> of power."</p>

<p>McLaurin sighed slowly, and rose to his feet. "What can
we do?"</p>

<p>"Thank our lucky stars that Faragaut here, and I, bought
up all the mercury in the system, and had it brought to
Earth. We at least have a supply of materials for the atostors."</p>

<p>"They don't seem to do much good."</p>

<p>"They're the best we've got. All the photocells on Earth
and Venus and Mercury are at present busy storing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
sun's power in atostors. I have two thousand tons of charged
mercury in our tanks here in the 'Lunar Bank.'"</p>

<p>"Much good that will do&mdash;they can just pull and pull and
pull till it's all gone. A starfish isn't strong, but he can open
the strongest oyster just because he can pull from now on.
You may have a lot of power&mdash;but."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we also have those new fifteen-foot UV beams.
And one fifteen-foot UV beam is worth, theoretically, nine
five-foot beams, and practically, a dozen. We have a dozen
of them. Remember, this place was designed not only to
protect itself, but Earth, too."</p>

<p>"They can still pull, can't they?"</p>

<p>"They'll stop pulling when they get their fingers burned.
In the meantime, why not use some of those IP ships to
bring in a few more cargoes of charged mercury?"</p>

<p>"They aren't good for much else, are they? I wonder if
those fellows have anything more we don't know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, probably. I'm going to work on that crumbler thing.
That's the first consideration now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"So we can move a ship. As it is, even those two we
built aren't any good."</p>

<p>"Would they be anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I think I might disturb those gentlemen slightly.
Remember, they each have a nose-beam eighteen feet across.
Exceedingly unpleasant customers."</p>

<p>"Score: Strangers; magnetic field, atomic bombs, atomic
power, crumbler ray. Home team; UV beams."</p>

<p>Kendall grinned. "I'd heard you were a pessimistic cuss
when battle started&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pessimistic, hell, I'm merely counting things up."</p>

<p>"McClellan had all the odds on Lee back in the Civil War
of the States&mdash;but Lee sent him home faster than he came."</p>

<p>"But Lee lost in the end."</p>

<p>"Why bring that up? I've got work to do." Still smiling,
Kendall went to the laboratory he had built up in the
"Lunar Bank." Devin was already there, calculating. He
looked unhappy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't do anything, as far as I can see. They're using
an electric field all right, and projecting it. I can't see how
we can do that."</p>

<p>"Neither can I," agreed Kendall, "so we can't use that
weapon. I really didn't want to anyway. Like the neutron
gun which I told Commander McLaurin would be useless as
a weapon, they'd be prepared for it, you can be sure. All
I want to do is fight it, and make their projection useless."</p>

<p>"Well, we have to know how they project it before we can
break up the projection, don't we?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. They're using an electric field of very high
frequency, but variable frequency. As far as I can see, all
we need is a similar variable electric field of a slightly different
frequency to heterodyne theirs into something quite harmless."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Devin. "We could, couldn't we? But how are
you going to do that?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to learn, that's all."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Buck Kendall started trying to learn. In the meantime, the
Mirans were taking over Jupiter. There were three IP stations
on the planet itself, but they were vastly hindered by
the thick, almost ultra-violet-proof atmosphere of Jupiter.
Their rays were weak. And the magnetic fields of the Mirans
were unaffected. Only their atomic bombs were hindered by
the heavier gravity that pulled the rocks back in place faster
than the bombs could throw them out. Still&mdash;a few hours
of work, and the IP stations on Jupiter had rolled wildly
across the flat plains of the planet like dented cans, to end
in utter destruction.</p>

<p>The Mirans had paid no attention to the fleeing passenger
and freighter ships that left the planet, loaded to the
utmost with human cargo, and absolutely no freight. The
IP fleet had to go to their rescue with oxygen tanks to
take care of the extra humans, but nearly three-quarters
of the population of Jupiter, a newly established population,
and hence a readily mobile one, was saved. The others, the
Mirans did not bother with particularly except when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
happened to be near where the Mirans wanted to work.
Then they were instantly destroyed by atomic bombing, or
gamma rays.</p>

<p>The Mirans settled almost at once, and began their work
of finding on Jupiter the badly needed atomic fuels. Machines
were set up, and work begun, Mirans laboring under
the gravity of the heavy planet. Then, fifty ships swam up
again, reloaded with fuel, and with crews consisting solely
of uninjured warriors, and started for Mars.</p>

<p>Mars was half way between her near conjunction and her
maximum elongation with respect to Jupiter at that time. The
Mirans knew their business though, for they started in on the
IP station on Phobos. They were practiced by this time,
and this IP station had only seven five-foot beams. In half
an hour that station fell, and its sister station on Deimos
followed. Three wounded ships returned to Jupiter, and ten
new ships came out. The attack on Mars itself was started.</p>

<p>Mars was a different proposition. There were thirty-two IP
stations here, one of them nearly as powerful as the Lunar
Bank station. It was equipped with four of the huge fifteen-foot
beams. And it had fifteen tons of mercury, more than
seven-eighths charged. The Mars Center Station was located
a short ten miles from the Mars Center City, and under
the immediate orders of the IP heads, Mars Center City
had been vacated.</p>

<p>For two days the Mirans hung off Mars, solidifying their
positions on Phobos and Deimos. Then, with sixty-two ships,
they attacked. They had made some very astute observations,
and they started on the smaller stations just beyond the
range of the Mars Center Station. Naturally, near so powerful
a center, these stations had never been strong. They fell
rapidly. But they had been counted on by Mars Center as
auxiliary supports. McLaurin had sent very definite orders
to Mars Center forbidding any action on their part, save
gathering of power-supplies.</p>

<p>At last the direct attack on Mars Center was launched. For
the first time, the Mirans saw one of the fifteen-foot beams.
Mars' atmosphere is thin, and there is little ozone. The ultra-violet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
beams were nearly as effective as in empty space.
When the Mirans dropped their ships, a full thirty of them,
into the circle formation, Mars Center answered at once. All
four beams started.</p>

<p>Those fifteen-foot beams, connected directly to huge atostor
release apparatus, delivered a maximum power of two
and three-quarter billion horsepower, each. The first Miran
ship struck, sparkled magnificently, and a terrific cascade of
white-hot metal rolled down from its nose. The great ship
nosed down and to the left abruptly, accelerated swiftly&mdash;and
crashed with tremendous energy on the plain outside of
Mars Center City. White, unwavering flames licked up suddenly,
and made a column five hundred feet high against
the dark sky. Then the wreck exploded with a violence that
left a crater half a mile across.</p>

<p>Three other ships had been struck, and were rapidly retreating.
Another try was made for the ring formation, and
four more ships were wounded, and replaced. The ring did
not retreat, but the great magnetic field started. Atomic and
gamma ray bombs started now, flashing sometimes dangerously
close to the station as its magnetic field battled the
rotating field of the ships. The four greater beams, and many
smaller ones were in swift and angry action. Not more than
a ten-second exposure could be endured by any one ship,
before it must retreat.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>For five minutes the Mirans hung doggedly at their task.
Then, wisely, they retreated. Of the fleet, not more than
seven ships remained untouched. Mars Center Station had
held&mdash;at what cost only they knew. Five hundred tons
of their mercury had been exhausted in that brief five minutes.
One hundred tons a minute had flowed into and out
of the atostor apparatus. Mars Center radioed for help, when
the fleet lifted.</p>

<p>There was one other station on Mars that stood a good
chance of survival, Deenmor Station, with three of the big
beams installed, and apparatus for their fourth was in the
station, and being rapidly worked over. McLaurin did a wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and courageous thing, at which every man on Mars cursed.
He ordered that all IP stations save these two be deserted,
and all mercury fuel reserves be moved to Deenmor and
Mars Center.</p>

<p>The Mirans could not land on the North Western section
of Mars, nor in the South Central region. Therefore Mars was
not exactly habitable to Miran ships, because the great beams
had been so perfectly figured that they were effective at a
range of nearly twelve hundred miles.</p>

<p>Deenmor station was attacked&mdash;but it was a half-hearted
attack, for Mirans were becoming distinctly skittish about fifteen-foot
UV beams. Two badly blistered ships&mdash;and the
Mirans retreated to Jupiter. But Mira held Phobos and Deimos.
In two weeks, they had set up cannon there, and proved
themselves accurate long-range gunners. Against the feeble attraction
of Deimos, and with Mars' gravity to help them,
they began bombarding the two stations, and anything that
attempted to approach them, with gamma and atomic explosive
bombs. Meanwhile they amused themselves occasionally
by planting a gamma-ray bomb in each of Mars' major cities.
They made Mars uninhabitable for Solarians as well as for
Mirans, at least until the deadly slow-action atomic explosives
wore off, or were removed.</p>

<p>Then the Mirans, after a lapse of three weeks while they
dug in their toes on Jupiter, prepared to leap. Earth was
the next goal. Miran scout-ships had been sent out before
this&mdash;and severely handled by the concentrated fleets of the
IP that hung grimly off Earth and Luna now. But the
scouts had learned one thing. Mirans could never hope to
attain a firm grasp on Earth while terribly armed Luna hung
like a Sword of Damocles over their heads. Further, attack
on Earth directly would be next to impossible, for, thanks
to Faragaut's Interplanetary Company, nearly all the mercury
metal in the system was safely lodged on Earth, and
saturated with power. Every major city had been equipped
with great UV apparatus. And neutron guns in plenty waited
on small ships just outside the atmosphere to explode harmlessly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
any atomic or gamma bombs Miran ships might attempt
to deposit.</p>

<p>An attack on Luna was the first step. But that terrible,
gigantic fort on Luna worried them. Yet while that fort
existed, Earth ships were free to come and go, for Mirans
could not afford to stand near. At a distance of twenty
thousand miles, small Miran ships had felt the touch of
those great UV beams.</p>

<p>Finally, a brief test-attack was made, with an entire fleet
of one hundred ships. They drew almost into position, faster
than light, faster than the signaling warnings could send
their messages. In position, all those great ships strained and
heaved at the mighty magnetic vortex that twisted at the
field of the fort. Instantly, twelve of the fifteen-foot UV
beams replied. And&mdash;two great UV beams of a size the
Mirans had never seen before, beams from the two ships, "S
Doradus" and "Cepheid."</p>

<p>The test-attack dissolved as suddenly as it had come.
The Mirans returned to Jupiter, and to the outer planets
where they had further established themselves. Most of the
Solar system was theirs. But the Solarians still held the
choicest planets&mdash;and kept the Mirans from using the mild-temperatured
Mars.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">They</span> can't take this, at least," sighed McLaurin as they
retreated from Luna.</p>

<p>"I didn't think they could&mdash;right away. I'm wondering
though if they haven't something we haven't seen yet. Besides
which&mdash;give them time, give them time."</p>

<p>"Well, give us time, too," snapped McLaurin. "How are
you coming?"</p>

<p>Buck smiled. "I'm sure I don't know. I have a machine
but I haven't the slightest idea of whether or not it's any
good."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I can destroy&mdash;I hope&mdash;but I can't build up their ray.
I can't test the machine because I haven't their ray to test
it against."</p>

<p>"What can we do to test it?"</p>

<p>"The only thing I can see is to call for volunteers&mdash;and
send out a six-man cruiser. If the ship's too small, they may
not destroy it with the big crumbler rays. If it's too large&mdash;and
the machine didn't work&mdash;we'd lose too much."</p>

<p>Twelve hours later, the IP men at the Lunar Bank fort
were lined up. McLaurin stepped up on the platform, and
addressed the men briefly, told them what was needed. Six
volunteers were selected by a process of elimination, those
who were married, had dependents, officers, and others were
refused. Finally, six men of the IP were chosen, neither rookies
nor veterans, six average men. And one average six-man
cruiser, one hundred and eleven feet long, twenty-two in
diameter. It was the T-208, a sister ship of the T-247, the
first ship to be destroyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The T-208 started out from Luna, and with full acceleration,
sped out toward Phobos. Slowly she circled the
satellite, while distant scouts kept her under view. Lazily,
the Miran patrol on Phobos watched the T-208, indifferent
to her. The T-208 dove suddenly, after five fruitless circles
of the tiny world, and with her four-foot UV beam flaming,
stabbed angrily at a flight of Miran scouts berthed in the
very shadow of a great battle cruiser, one of the interstellar
ships stationed here on Phobos.</p>

<p>Four of the little ships slumped in incandescence. Angrily
the terrific sword of energy slashed at the frail little scouts.</p>

<p>Angrily the Miran interstellar ship shot herself abruptly
into action against this insolent cruiser. The cruiser launched
a flight of the mercury-torpedoes. Flashing, burning, ultra-violet
energy flooded the great ship, harmlessly, for the men
were, as usual, protected. The Miran answered with the
neutron beam, atomic and gamma bombs&mdash;and the crumbler
ray.</p>

<p>Gently, softly a halo of shimmering-violet luminescence
built up about the T-208. The UV beam continued to flare,
wavering slightly in its aim&mdash;then fell way off to one side.
The T-208 staggered suddenly, wandered from her course&mdash;whole,
but uncontrolled. For the men within the ship were
dead.</p>

<p>Majestically the Miran swung along beside the dead ship,
a great magnetic tow-cable shot out toward it, to shy off at
first, then slowly to be adjusted, and take hold in the magnetic
shield of the T-208. The pilots of the watching scout-ships
turned away. They knew what would happen.</p>

<p>It did. Five&mdash;ten&mdash;twenty seconds passed. Then the "dead-man"
took over the ship&mdash;and the stored power in the atostor
tanks blasted in a terrible flame that shattered the metal
hull to molecular fragments. The interstellar cruiser shuddered,
and rolled half over at the blasting pressure. Leaking
seams appeared in her plates.</p>

<p>The scouts raced back to Luna as the Miran settled heavily,
and a trifle clumsily to Phobos. Miran radio-beams were
forcing their way out toward the Miran station on Europa,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to be relayed to the headquarters on Jupiter, just as Solarian
radio beams were thrusting through space toward Luna.
Said the Miran messages: "Their ships no longer crumble."
Said the Solarian messages: "The ships no longer crumble&mdash;but
the men die."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>His deep eyes burning tensely, Buck Kendall heard the
messages coming in, and rose slowly from his seat to pace
the floor. "I think I know why," he said at last. "I should
have thought. For that too can be prevented."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what in the name of the Planets?" asked McLaurin.
"It didn't kill the men in the forts&mdash;why does it kill
the men in the ships, when the ships are protected?"</p>

<p>"The protection kills them."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but they had the protective oscillations on all the
way out!" protested the Commander.</p>

<p>"Think how it works though. Think, man. The enemy's
field is an electric-field oscillation. We combat it by setting up
a similar oscillating field in the metal of the hull ourselves.
Because the metal conducts the strains, they meet,
and oppose. It is not a shield&mdash;a shield is impossible, as
I have said, because of energy concentration factors. If their
beam carried a hundred thousand horsepower in a ten-foot
square beam, in every ten square feet of our shield, we'd
have to have one hundred thousand horsepower. In other
words, hundreds of times as much energy would be needed
in the shield, as they used in their beam. We can't afford
that. We had to let the beams oppose our oscillations in
the metal, where, because the metal conducts, they meet on
an equal basis. But&mdash;when two oscillations of slightly different
frequency meet, what is the result?"</p>

<p>"In this case, a heterodyne frequency of a lower, and
harmless frequency."</p>

<p>"So I thought. I was partly right. It does <i>not</i> harm the
metal. But it kills the men. It is super-sonic. The terrible,
shrill sounds destroy the cells of the men's bodies. Then,
when their dead hands release the controls, the automatic
switches blow up the ship."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"God! We stop one menace&mdash;and it is like the Hydra.
For every head we lop off, two spring up."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but they are lesser heads. Look, what is the fundamental
difference between sound and light?"</p>

<p>"One is a vibration of matter and the&mdash;ah&mdash;eliminate the
material contact!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! All we need to do is to let the ships operate
airless, the men in space suits. Then the air cannot carry
the sounds to them. And by putting special damping materials
in their suits, we can stop the vibrations that would
reach them through their feet and hands. Another six-man
ship must go out&mdash;but this ship will come back!"</p>

<p>And with the order for another experimental ship, went the
orders for commercial supplies of this new apparatus. Every
IP ship must be equipped to resist it.</p>

<p>Buck Kendall sailed on the six-man scout that went out
this time. Again they swooped once at Phobos, again Miran
scout-ships crumbled under the attack of the vicious UV
beams. The Mirans were not waiting contemptuously this
time. In an instant the great interstellar ship rose from its
berth, its weapons working angrily. The crumbler ray snapped
out at the T-253.</p>

<p>Kendall stared into the periscope visor intently. Clumsily
his padded hands worked at the specially adapted controls.
The soft hiss of the oxygen release into his suit disturbed him
slightly. The radio-phones in his helmet carried all the conversations
in the ship to him with equal clarity. He watched
as the great ship angled angrily up&mdash;</p>

<p>His vision was momentarily obscured by a violet glow
that built up and reached out gently from every point of
metal in the ship. The instant Kendall saw that, the T-253
was fleeing under his hands. The test had been made. Now all
he desired was safety again. The ion-rockets flared recklessly
as, crushed under an acceleration of four Earth-gravities,
he sank heavily into his seat. Grimly the Miran ship
was pursuing them, easily keeping up with the fleeing midget.
The crumbler became more intense, the violet glow more
vivid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The UV beam was reaching out directly behind now. The&mdash;</p>

<p>With a cry of agony, Kendall ripped the radio-phone
connection out of his suit. A soft hiss of leaking air warned
him of too great violence only minutes later. For his ears
had been deafened by the sudden shriek of a tremendous
signal from outside!</p>

<p>Instantly Kendall knew what that meant. And he could
not communicate with his men! There was no metal in these
special suits, even the oxygen tanks were made of synthetic
plastics of tremendous strength. No scrap of vibrating metal
was permissible. The padded gloves and boots protected him&mdash;but
there was a new and different type of crackle and
haze from the metal points now. It was almost invisible in
the practically airless ship, but Kendall saw it.</p>

<p>Presently he felt it, as he desperately increased his acceleration.
Slow creeping heat was attacking him. The heat
was increasing rapidly now. Desperately he was working at
the crumbler-protection controls&mdash;but immediately set them
back as they were. He had to have the crumbler protection
as well&mdash;!</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Grimly the great Miran ship hung right beside them.
Angrily the two four-foot UV beams flashed back&mdash;seeking
some weak spot. There were none. At her absolute maximum
of acceleration the little ship plunged on. Gamma and atomic
bombs were washing her in flame. The heavy blocks of paraffin
between her walls were long since melted, retained
only by the presence of the metal walls. Smoke was beginning
to filter out now, and Kendall recognized a new,
and deadlier menace! Heat&mdash;quantities of heat were being
poured into the little ship, and the neutron guns were doing
their best to add to it. The paraffin was confined in there&mdash;and
like any substance, it could be volatilized, and as
a vapor, develop pressure&mdash;explosive pressure!</p>

<p>The Miran seemed satisfied in his tactics so far&mdash;and
changed them. Forty-seven million miles from Earth, the
Miran simply accelerated a bit more, and crowded the Solarian
ship a bit. White-faced, Buck Kendall was forced to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
turn a bit aside. The Miran turned also. Kendall turned a
bit more&mdash;</p>

<p>Flashing across his range of vision at an incredible speed,
a tiny thing, no more than twenty feet long and five in
diameter, a scout-ship appeared. Its tiny nose ultra-violet
beam was blasting a solid cylinder of violet incandescence
a foot across in the hull of the Miran&mdash;and, to the Miran,
angling swiftly across his range of vision. Its magnetic field
clashed for a thousandth of a second with the T-253, instantly
meeting, and absorbing the fringing edges. Then&mdash;it
swept through the Miran's magnetic shield as easily. The delicate
instruments of the scout instantaneously adjusted its
own magnetic field as much as possible. There was resistance,
enormous resistance&mdash;the ship crumpled in on itself, the tail
vanished in dust as a sweeping crumbler beam caught it at
last&mdash;and the remaining portion of the ship plowed into
the nose of the Miran.</p>

<p>The Miran's force-control-room was wrecked. For perhaps
a minute and a half, the ship was without control, then the
control was re-established&mdash;and in vain the telescopes and
instruments searched for the T-253. Lightless, her rockets out
now, her fields damped down to extinction, the T-253 was lost
in the pulsing, gyrating fields of half a dozen scout-ships.</p>

<p>Kendall looked grimly at the crushed spot on the nose of
the Miran. His ship was drifting slowly away from the
greater ship. Presently, however, the Miran put on speed in
the direction of Earth, and the T-253 fell far behind. The
Miran was not seriously injured. But that scout pilot, in
sacrificing life, had thrown dust in their eyes for just those
few moments Kendall had needed to lose a lightless ship
in lightless space&mdash;lightless&mdash;for the Mirans at any rate. The
IP ships had been covered with a black paint, and in no
time at all, Kendall had gotten his ship into a position where
the energy radiations of the sun made him undetectable from
the Miran's position, since the radiation of his own ship,
even in the heat range, was mingled with the direct radiation
of the sun. The sun was in the Miran's "eyes," both
actual and instrumental.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later the Miran returned, passed the still-lightless
ship at a distance of five million miles, and settled to
Phobos for the slight repairs needed.</p>

<p>Twelve hours later, the T-253 settled to Luna, for the
many rearrangements she would need.</p>

<p>"I rather knew it was coming," Kendall admitted sadly,
"but danged if I didn't forget all about it. And&mdash;cost the
life of one of the finest men in the system. Jehnson's family
get a permanent pension just twice his salary, McLaurin.
In the meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was it? Pure heat, but how?"</p>

<p>"Pure radio. Nothing but short-wave radio directed at
us. They probably had the apparatus, knew how to make
it, but that's not a good type of heat ray, because a radio
tube is generally less than eighty percent efficient, which is
a whale of a loss when you're working in a battle, and
a whale of an inconvenience. We were heated only four
times as much as the Miran. He had to pump that heat into
a heat-reservoir&mdash;a water tank probably&mdash;to protect himself.
Highly inefficient and ineffective against a large ship.
Also, he had to hold his beam on us nearly ten minutes
before it would have become unbearable. He was again,
trying to kill the men, and not the ship. The men are the
weakest point, obviously."</p>

<p>"Can you overcome that?"</p>

<p>"Obviously, no. The thing works on pure energy. I'd have
to match his energy to neutralize it. You knew it's an old
proposition, that if you could take a beam of pure, monochromatic
light and divide it exactly in half, and then recombine
it in perfect interference, you'd have annihilation of
energy. Cancellation to extinction. The trouble is, you never
do get that. You can't get monochromatic light, because
light can't be monochromatic. That's due to the Heisenberg
Uncertainty&mdash;my pet bug-bear. The atom that radiates the
light, must be moving. If it isn't, the emission of the light
itself gives it a kick that moves it. Now, no matter what the
quantum <i>might</i> have been, it loses energy in kicking the
atom. That changes the situation instantly, and incidentally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the 'color' of the light. Then, since all the radiating atoms
won't be moving alike, etc., the mass of light can't be
monochromatic. Therefore perfect interference is impossible.</p>

<p>"The way that relates to the problem in hand, is that we
can't possibly destroy his energy. We can, as we do in the
crumbler stunt, change it. He can't, I suspect, put too
much power behind his crumbler, or he'd have crumbling
going on at home. We get a slight heating from it, anyway.
Into the bargain, his radio was after us, and his neutrons
naturally carried energy. Now, no matter what we do, we've
got that to handle. When we fight his crumbler, we actually
add heat-energy to it, ourselves, and make the heating effect
just twice as bad. If we try to heterodyne his radio&mdash;presto&mdash;it
has twice the heat energy anyway, though we might
reduce it to a frequency that penetrated the ship instead of
all staying in it. But by the proposition, we have to use as
much energy, and in fact, remember the 80% rule. We've
got to take it and like it."</p>

<p>"But," objected McLaurin, "we <i>don't</i> like it."</p>

<p>"Then build ships as big as his, and he'll quit trying to
roast you. Particularly if the inner walls are synthetic plastics.
Did you know I used them in the 'S Doradus' and 'Cepheid'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Were you thinking of that?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;just luck&mdash;and the fact that they're light, strong as
steel almost, and can be manufactured in forms much more
quickly. Only the outer hull is tungsten-beryllium. The advantage
in this will be that nearly all the energy will be
absorbed outside, and we'll radiate pretty fast, particularly
as that tungsten-beryllium has a high radiation-factor in the
long heat range."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, ordinary polished silver is a mighty poor radiator.
Homely example: Try waiting for your coffee to cool if it's
in a polished silver pot. Then try it in a tungsten-beryllium
pot. No matter how you polish that tungsten-beryllium,
the stuff WILL radiate heat. That's why an IP ship is
always so blamed cold. You know the passenger ships use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
polished aluminum outer walls. The big help is, that the
tungsten-beryllium will throw off the energy pretty fast, and
in a big ship, with a whale of a lot of matter to heat, the
Strangers will simply give up the idea."</p>

<p>"Yes, but only two ships in the system compare with them
in size."</p>

<p>"Sorry&mdash;but I didn't build the IP fleet, and there are
lots of tungsten and beryllium on Earth. Enough anyway."</p>

<p>"Will they use that beam on the fort? And can't we use
the thing on them?"</p>

<p>"They won't and we won't&mdash;though we could. A bank
of those new million watt tubes&mdash;perhaps a hundred of
them&mdash;and we'd have a pretty effective heater&mdash;but an
awful waste of power. I've got something better."</p>

<p>"New?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat. I've found out how to make the mirror field
in a plate of metal, instead of a block. Come on to the lab,
and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"What's the advantage? Oh&mdash;weight saved, and silver
metal saved."</p>

<p>"A lot more than that, Mac. Watch."</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>At the laboratory, the new apparatus looked immensely
lighter and simpler than the old. The atostor, the ionizer, and
the twin ion-projectors were as before, great, rigid, metal
structures that would maintain the meeting point of the ions
with inflexible exactitude under any acceleration strains.
But now, instead of the heavy silver block in which a mirror
was figured, the mirror consisted of a polished silver
plate, parabolic to be sure, but little more than a half-inch
in thickness. It was mounted in a framework of complex,
stout metal braces.</p>

<p>Kendall started the ion-flame at low intensity, so the UV
beam was little more than a spotlight.</p>

<p>"You missed the point, Mac. Now&mdash;watch that tungsten-beryllium
plate. I'll hold the power steady. It's an eighteen-inch
beam&mdash;and now the energy is just sufficient to heat
that tungsten plate to bright red. But&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Kendall turned over a small rheostat control&mdash;and abruptly
the eighteen-inch diameter spot on the tungsten-beryllium
plate began contracting; it contracted till it was a blazing,
sparkling spot of molten incandescence less than an inch
across!</p>

<p>"That's the advantage of focus. At this distance of a few
hundred feet with a small beam I can do that. With a
twenty-foot beam, I can get a two-foot spot at a distance of
nearly ten miles! That means that the receiving end will have
the pleasure of handling <i>one hundred times the energy concentration</i>.
That would punch a hole through most anything.
All you have to do is focus it. The trouble being, if it's out
of focus the advantage is more than lost. So if there's any
question about getting the focus, we'll get along without
it."</p>

<p>"A real help, if you do. That would punch a hole before
the Stranger ship could turn away as they do now."</p>

<p>Kendall nodded. "That's what I was after. It is mainly
for the forts, though. We'll have to signal the dope to the
Mars Center and Deenmor stations. They can fix it up,
themselves. In the meantime&mdash;all we can do is hold on
and hunt, and let's hope better than the Strangers do."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sadly</span> the convalescent Gresth Gkae listened to the reports
of his lieutenants. More and more disgraced he felt as he
realized how badly he had blundered in reporting the people
of this system unable to cope with the attackers' weapons.
Gresth Gkae looked up at his old friend and physician, Merth
Skahl. He shook his head slowly. "I'm afraid, Merth Skahl. I
am afraid. We have, perhaps, made a mistake. The better
and the stronger alone should rule. Aye, but is the <i>stronger</i>
always the <i>better</i>? I am afraid we have mistaken the Truth
in assuming this. If we have&mdash;then may Jarth, Lord of Truth
and Wisdom punish us. Mighty Jarth, if I have mistaken
in following my judgments, it is not from disobedience, it is
lack of Thy knowledge. The strongest&mdash;they are not always
the better, are they?"</p>

<p>Merth Skahl bent sharply over his friend. "Quiet thyself,
Gresth Gkae. You know, and I know, you have done
only your best, and surely Jarth himself can ask no better of
any one. You must rest, for only by rest can those terrible
burns be healed. All your <i>stheen</i> over half the body-area
was burned off. You have been delirious for many days."</p>

<p>"But Merth Skahl, think&mdash;have we disobeyed Jarth's will?
It is, we know, his will that only the best and the strongest
shall rule&mdash;but are the best always the strongest? An imbecile
adult could destroy the life of a genius-grade child. The
strongest wins, but not the best. Such would not be the will
of Jarth. If we be the stronger, <i>and</i> the best, then it is right
and just that these strange creatures should be destroyed
that we may have a stable world of stable light and heat.
But look and see, with what terrible swiftness these strange
creatures have learned! May it not be they are the better
race&mdash;that it is <i>we</i> who are the weaker and the poorer?
Can it be that Jarth has brought us together that these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
people might learn&mdash;and destroy us? If they be the stronger,
and the better&mdash;then may Jarth's will be done. But we must
test our strength to the utmost. I must rise, and go to my
laboratory soon. They have set it up?"</p>

<p>"Aye, they have, Gresth Gkae. But remember, the weak
and the sick make faults the strong and the well do not.
Better that you rest yourself. There is little you can do while
your body seeks to recover from these terrible burns."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, my friend, wrong. Don't you see that
my mind is clear&mdash;that it is the mind which must fight
in these battles, for surely the man is weak against such
things as this infra-X-radiation? Why, I am better able to
fight now than are you, for I am a trained fighter of the
mind, while you are a trained healer of the body. These
strange beings with their stiff arms and legs, their tender
skins, and&mdash;and their swift minds have fought us all too
well. If we must test, let it be a test. I have heard how
they so quickly solved the riddle of the crumbling field.
That took us longer, and we designed it. The Counsel of
Worlds put me in command, let me up, Skahl, I must work."</p>

<p>Concerned, the physician looked down at him. Finally he
spoke again. "No, I will not permit you to leave the hospital-ship.
You must stay here, but if, as you have said, the
mind is what must fight, then surely you can fight well
from here, for your mind is here."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot, and you well know it. I may shorten my
life, but what matter. 'Death is the end toward which the
chemical reaction, Life, tends,'" quoted the scientist. "You
know I have left my children&mdash;my immortality is assured
through them. I can afford to die in peace, if it assures their
welfare. Time is precious, and while my mind might work
from here, it must have data on which to work. For that,
I must go to the laboratories. Help me, Merth Skahl."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the physician granted the request, but begged
of Gresth Gkae a promise of at least six hours rest in every
fifteen, and a good sleep of at least twenty-seven hours every
"night." Gresth Gkae agreed, and from a wheelchair, conducted
his work, began a new line of experimentation he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hoped would yield them the weapon they needed. Under
him, the staff of scientists worked, aiding and advising and
suggesting. The apparatus was built, tested, and found
wanting. Time and again as the days passed, they watched
Gresth Gkae, gaining strength very, very slowly, taken away
despondent at the end of his forty hours of work.</p>

<p>A dozen expeditions were sent to Jupiter's poles to
watch and measure and study the tremendous auroral displays
there, where Jupiter's vast magnetic field sucked in
countless quintillions of the flying electrons from the sun,
and brought them circling in, in a vast, magnificent display
of auroral ionization.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Expeditions went to the great Southern Plateau, the Plateau
of Storms, where the titanic air currents resulted in an
everlasting display of terrific lightnings, great burning balls of
electric force floating dangerous and deadly across the frozen,
ultra-cold plain.</p>

<p>And the expeditions brought back data. Yet still Gresth
Gkae could not sleep, his thoughts intruding constantly.
Hours Merth Skahl spent with him, calming him to sleep.</p>

<p>"But what is this constant search? It is little enough I
know of science, but why do you send our men to these
spots of wonderfully beautiful, but useless natural forces.
Can we somehow, do you think, turn them against the people
of these worlds?"</p>

<p>Softly the old Miran smiled. "Yes, you might say so. For
look, it is the strange balls of electric force I want to know
about. Sthor had few, but occasionally we saw them. Never
were they properly investigated. I want to know their secret,
for I am sure they are balls of electric forces not vastly
dissimilar from the nucleus of the atom. Always we have
known that no system of purely electrical forces could remain
stable. Yet these strange balls of energy do. How is it?
I am sure it will be of vast importance. But the direct secret
I hope to learn is in this: What can be done with electric
fields can nearly always be duplicated, or paralleled in
magnetic fields. If I can learn how to make these electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
balls of energy, can I not hope to make similar magnetic
balls of energy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see&mdash;that would seem true. But what benefit
would you derive from that? You have magnetic beams
now, and yet they are useless because you can get nowhere
near the forts. How then would these benefit you?"</p>

<p>"We can do nothing to those forts, because of that magnetic
shield. Could we once break it down, then the
fort is helpless, and one or two small atomic bombs destroy
it. But&mdash;we cannot stay near, for the terrible infra-X-rays
of theirs burn holes in our ships, and&mdash;in our men.</p>

<p>"But look you, I can drop many atomic bombs from a
distance where their beams are ineffective. Suppose I <i>do</i> make
a magnetic ball of energy, a magnetic bomb. Then&mdash;I can
drop it from a distance! We have learned that the power
supply of these forts is very great&mdash;but not endless, as is
ours now, thanks to the vast supplies of power metal on this
heavy planet. Then all we need do is stay at a distance where
they cannot reach us&mdash;and drop magnetic bombs. Ah, they
will be stopped, and their energy absorbed. But we can
keep it up, day after day, and slowly drain out their power.
Then&mdash;then our atomic bombs can destroy those forts, and
we can move on!" But suddenly the animation and strength
left his voice. He turned a sad, downcast face to his friend.
"But Merth Skahl, we can't do it," he complained.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;now I can see why you so want to continue this
wearing and worrying work. You need time, Gresth Gkae,
only time for success. Tomorrow it may be that you will
see the first hint that will lead you to success."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I only hope it, Merth Skahl, I only hope it."</p>

<p>But it was the next day that they saw the first glimpse of
the secret, and saw the path that might lead to hope and
success. In a week they were sending electric bombs across
the laboratory. And in three days more, a magnetic bomb
streaked dully across the laboratory to a magnetic shield they
had set up, and buried itself in it, to explode in brilliant light
and heat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>From that day Gresth Gkae began to mend. In the three
weeks that were needed to build the apparatus into ships,
he regained strength so that when the first flight of five
interstellar ships rose from Jupiter, he was on the flagship.</p>

<p>To Phobos they went first, to the little inner satellite of
Mars, scarcely eight miles in diameter, a tiny bit of broken
metal and rock, utterly airless, but scarcely more than 3700
miles from the surface of Mars below. The Mars Center
and Deenmor forts were wasting no power raying a ship
at that distance. They could, of course, have damaged it, but
not severely enough to make up for the loss of their strictly
limited power. The photocells had been working overtime,
every minute of available light had been used, and
still scarcely 2100 tons of charged mercury remained in the
tanks of Mars Center and 1950 in the tanks at Deenmor.</p>

<p>The flight of five ships settled comfortably upon Phobos,
while the three relieved of duty started back to Jupiter.
Immediately work was begun on the attack. The ships
were first landed on the near side, while the apparatus of
the projectors was unloaded, then the great ships moved
around to the far side. Phobos of course rotated with one
face fixed irrevocably toward Mars itself, the other always
to the cold of space. Great power leads trailed beneath the
ships, and to the dark side. Then there were huge water
lines for cooling. On this almost weightless world, where
the great ships weighing hundreds of thousands of tons
on a planet, weighed so little they were frequently moved
about by a single man, the laying of five miles of water
conduit was no impossibility.</p>

<p>Then they were ready. Mars Center came first. Automatic
devices kept the aim exact, as the first of the magnetic
bombs started down. At five-second intervals they were
projected outward, invisible globes of concentrated magnetic
energy, undetectable in space. Seven seconds passed before
the first became dimly visible in the thin air of Mars. It
floated down, it would miss the fort it seemed&mdash;so far to
one side&mdash; Abruptly it turned, and darted with tremendously
accelerating speed for the great magnetic field of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
fort. With a vast blast of light, it exploded. Five seconds
later a second exploded. And a third.</p>

<p>Mars Center signaled scoffingly that the bombs were all
being stopped dead in the magnetic atmosphere, after the
bombardment had been witnessed from Earth and Luna. An
hour later they gave a report that they were concentrated
magnetic fields of energy that would be rather dangerous&mdash;if
it weren't that they couldn't even stand into the magnetic
atmosphere. Three hours later Mars Center reported
that they contained considerably more energy than had at
first been thought. Further, which they had not carefully
considered at first, they were taking energy with them!
They were taking away about an equal amount of energy as
each blew up.</p>

<p>It was only a half-hour after that that the men at Mars
Center realized perfectly what it meant. Their power was
being drained just a little bit better than twice as fast as
they generated during the day&mdash;and since Phobos spun
so swiftly across the sky.</p>

<p>Deenmor got the attack just about the time Mars Center
was released. Deenmor immediately began seeking for the
source of it. Somewhere on Phobos&mdash;but where?</p>

<p>The Mirans were experts at camouflage. Deenmor Station,
realizing the menace, immediately rayed the "projector." They
tore up a great deal of harmless rock with their huge UV
rays. But the bomb device continued to throw one bomb
each five seconds.</p>

<p>When Deenmor operated from Phobos' position, Mars Center
was exposed to the deadly, constant drain. A day or
two later, the bombs were coming one each second and a
half, for more ships had joined in the work on Phobos.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae saw the work was going nicely. He knew
that now it was only a question of time before those magnetic
shields would fail&mdash;and then the whole fort would be
powerless. Maybe&mdash;it might be a good idea, when the forts
were powerless to investigate instead of blowing them up.
There might be many interesting and worthwhile pieces of
apparatus&mdash;particularly the UV beam's apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buck Kendall</span> entered the Communications room rather
furtively. He hated the place. Cole was there, and McLaurin.
Mac was looking tired and drawn, Cole not so tired, but
equally drawn. The signals were coming through fairly well,
because most of the disturbance was rising where the signals
rose, and all the disturbance, practically, was magnetic
rather than electric.</p>

<p>"Deenmor is sending, Buck," McLaurin said as he entered.
"They're down to the last fifty-five tons. They'll have more
time now&mdash;a rest while Phobos sinks. Mars Center has another
250 tons, but&mdash;it's just a question of time. Have you
any hope to offer?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kendall in a strained voice. "But, Mac, I don't
think men like those are afraid to die. It's dying uselessly
they fear. Tell 'em&mdash;tell 'em they've defended not alone
Mars, but all the system, in holding up the Strangers on Mars.
We here on Luna have been safer because of them. And
tell&mdash;Mac, tell them that in the meantime, while they defended
us, and gave us time to work, we have begun to
see the trail that will lead to victory."</p>

<p>"<i>You have!</i>" gasped McLaurin.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but they will never know!" Kendall left hastily.
He went and stood moodily looking at the calculator machines&mdash;the
calculator machines that refused to give the answers
he sought. No matter how he might modify that original
idea of his, no matter what different line of attack he
might try in solving the problems of Space and Matter, while
he used the system he <i>knew</i> was right&mdash;the answer came
down to that deadly, hope-blasting expression that meant
only "uncertain."</p>

<p>Kendall switched on a noisy, humming fan viciously. The
too-intelligible signals were drowned in its sound.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;tell them to&mdash;destroy the apparatus before the last
of the power is gone," McLaurin ordered softly.</p>

<p>The men in Deenmor station did slightly better than
that. Gradually they cut down their magnetic shield, and
some of the magnetic bombs tore and twisted viciously at the
heavy metal walls. The thin atmosphere of Mars leaked in.
Grimly the men waited. Atomic bombs&mdash;or ships to investigate?
It did not matter much to them personally&mdash;</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae smiled with his old vigor as he ordered one
of the great interstellar ships to land beside the powerless
station, approaching from such an angle that the still-active
Mars Center station could not attack. One of the fleet of Phobos
rose, and circled about the planet, and settled gracefully
beside the station. For half an hour it lay there quietly,
waiting and watching. Then a crew of two dozen Mirans
started across the dry, crumbly powder of Mars' sands,
toward the fort. Simultaneously almost, three things happened.
A three-foot UV beam wiped out the advancing
party. A pair of fifteen-foot beams cut a great gaping hole
in the wall of the interstellar ship, as it darted up, like a
startled quail, its weapons roaring defiance, only to fall
back, severely wounded.</p>

<p>And the radio messages pounded out to Earth the first description
of the Miran people. Methodically the men in Deenmor
station used all but one ton of their power to completely
and forever wreck and destroy the interstellar cripple that
floundered for a few moments on the sands a bare mile
away. Presently, before Deenmor was through with it, the
atomic bombs stopped coming, and the atomic shells. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
magnetic shield that had been re-established for the few
minutes of this last, dying sting, fell.</p>

<p>Deenmor station vanished in a sudden, colossal tongue
of blue-green light as the ton of atomically distorted mercury
was exploded by a projector beam turned on the tank.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>It was long gone, when the first atomic bombs and magnetic
bombs dropped from Phobos reached the spot, and
only hot rock and broken metal remained.</p>

<p>Mars Center failed in fact the next time Phobos rode high
over it. The apparatus here had been carefully destroyed by
technicians with a view of making it indecipherable, but the
Mirans made it even more certain, for no ship settled here
to investigate, but a stream of atomic bombs that lasted for
over an hour, and churned the rock to dust, and the dust
to molten lava, in which pools of fused tungsten-beryllium
alloy bubbled slowly and sank.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jarth&mdash;they are a brave race, whatever we may say
of their queer shape," sighed Gresth Gkae as the last of Mars
Center sank in bubbling lava. "They stung as they died."
For some minutes he was silent.</p>

<p>"We must move on," he said at length. "I have been thinking,
and it seems best that a few ships land here, and establish
a fort, while some twenty move on to the satellite
of the third planet and destroy the fort there. We cannot
operate against the planet while that hangs above us."</p>

<p>Seven ships settled to Mars, while the fleet came up from
Jupiter to join with Gresth Gkae's flight of ships on its way
to Luna.</p>

<p>An automatically controlled ship was sent ahead, and began
the bombardment. It approached slowly, and was not
destroyed by the UV beams till it had come to within 40,000
miles of the fort. At 60,000 Gresth Gkae stationed his
fleet&mdash;and returned to 150,000 immediately as the titanic
UV beams of the Lunar Fort stretched out to their maximum
range. The focus made a difference. One ship started limping
back to Jupiter, in tow of a second, while the rest began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the slow, methodical work of wearing down the defenses
of the Lunar Fort.</p>

<p>Kendall looked out at the magnificent display of clashing,
warring energies, the great, whirling spheres and discs of
opalescent flame, and turned away sadly. "The men at
Deenmor must have watched that for days. And at Mars
Center."</p>

<p>"How long can we hold out?" asked McLaurin.</p>

<p>"Three weeks or so, at the present rate. That's a long time,
really. And we can escape if we want to. The UV beams
here have a greater range than any weapon the Strangers
have, and with Earth so near&mdash;oh, we could escape. Little
good."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I," said Buck Kendall, suddenly savage, "am going to
consign all the math machines in the universe to eternal
damnation&mdash;and go ahead and build a machine anyway.
I <i>know</i> that thing ought to be right. The math's wrong."</p>

<p>"There is no other thing to try?"</p>

<p>"A billion others. I don't know how many others. We
ought to get atomic energy somehow. But that thing infuriates
me. A hundred things that math has predicted, that
I have checked by experiment, simple little things. But&mdash;when
I carry it through to the point where I can get something
useful&mdash;it wriggles off into&mdash;uncertainty."</p>

<p>Kendall stalked off to the laboratory. Devin was there working
over the calculus machines, and Kendall called him
angrily. Then more apologetic, he explained it was anger
at himself. "Devin, I'm going to make that thing, if it blows
up and kills me. I'm going to make that thing if this whole
fort blows up and kills me. That math has blown up in my
face for four solid months, and half killed me, so I'm going
to kill it. Come on, we'll make that damned junk."</p>

<p>Angrily, furiously, Kendall drove his helpers to the task.
He had worked out the apparatus in plan a dozen times,
and now he had the plans turned into patterns, the patterns
into metal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Saucily, the "S Doradus" made the trip to and from Earth
with patterns, and with metal, with supplies and with
apparatus. But she had to dodge and fight every inch of the
way as the Miran ships swooped down angrily at her. A
fighting craft could get through when the Miran fleet was
withdrawn to some distance, but the Mirans were careful
that no heavy-loaded freighter bearing power supply should
get through.</p>

<p>And Gresth Gkae waited off Luna in his great ship, and
watched the steady streams of magnetic bombs exploding on
the magnetic shield of the Lunar Fort. Presently more ships
came up, and added their power to the attack, for here,
the photo-cell banks could gather tremendous energy, and
Gresth Gkae knew he would need to overcome this, and
drain the accumulated power.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae felt certain if he could once crack this nut,
break down Earth, he would have the system. This was the
home planet. If this fell, then the two others would follow
easily, despite the fact that the few forts on the innermost
planet, Mercury, could gather energy from the sun at a rate
greater than their ships could generate.</p>

<p>It took Kendall two weeks and three days to set up his
preliminary apparatus. They had power for perhaps four days
more, thanks to the fact that the long Lunar day had begun
shortly after Gresth Gkae's impatient attack had started.
Also, the "S Doradus" had brought in several hundred tons
of charged mercury on each trip, though this was no great
quantity individually, it had mounted up in the ten trips
she had made. The "Cepheid," her sister ship, had gone
along on seven of the trips, and added to the total.</p>

<p>But at length the apparatus was set up. It was peculiar
looking, and it employed a great deal of power, nearly
as much as a UV beam in fact. McLaurin looked at it sceptically
toward the last, and asked Buck: "What do you expect
it to do?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Kendall sourly, "uncertain. The result will
be uncertainty itself."</p>

<p>Which, considering things, was a surprisingly accurate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
statement. Kendall gave the exact answer. He meant to give
an ironic comment. For the mathematics had been perfectly
correct, only Buck Kendall misinterpreted the answer.</p>

<p>"I've followed the math with mechanism all the way
through," he explained, "and I'm putting power into it.
That's all I know. Somewhere, by the laws of cause and
effect, this power <i>must</i> show itself again&mdash;despite what the
damn math says."</p>

<p>And in that, of course, Kendall was wrong. Because the
laws of cause and effect didn't hold in what he was doing
now.</p>

<p>"Do you want to watch?" he asked at length. "I'm all
set to try it."</p>

<p>"I suppose I may as well." McLaurin smiled. "In our close-knit
little community the fate of one is of interest to all.
If it's going to blow up, I might as well be here, and if it
isn't, I want to be."</p>

<p>Kendall smiled appreciatively and replied: "Let it be on
thy own head. Here she goes."</p>

<p>He walked over to the power board, and took command.
Devin, and a squad of other scientists were seated about
the room with every conceivable type and combination of
apparatus. Kendall wanted to see what this was doing.
"Tubes," he called. "Circuits A and D. Tie-ins." He stopped,
the preliminary switches in. "Main circuit coming." With a
jerk he threw over the last contact. A heavy relay thudded
solidly. The hum of a straining atostor. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>An electric motor, humming smoothly stopped with a
jerk. "This," it remarked in a deep throaty voice, "is probably
the last stand of humanity."</p>

<p>The galvanometer before which Devin was seated apparently
agreed. In a rather high pitched voice it pointed
out that: "If the Lunar Fort falls, the Earth&mdash;" It stopped
abruptly, and an electroscope beside Douglass took up the
thread in a high, shrill voice, rather slurred, "&mdash;will be
directly attacked."</p>

<p>"This," resumed the motor in a hoarse voice, "will certainly
mean the end of humanity." The motor gave up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
discourse and hummed violently into action&mdash;in reverse!</p>

<p>"My God!" Kendall pulled the switch open with a sagging
jaw and staring eyes.</p>

<p>The men in the room burst into sudden startled exclamations.</p>

<p>Kendall didn't give them time. His jaw snapped shut, and
a blazing light of wondrous joy shone in his eyes. He instantly
threw the switch in again. Again the humming atostor,
the strain&mdash;</p>

<p>Slowly Devin lifted from his seat. With thrashing arms
and startled, staring eyes, he drifted gently across the room.
Abruptly he fell to the floor, unhurt by the light Lunar
gravity.</p>

<p>"I advise," said the motor in its grumbling voice, "an
immediate exodus." It stopped speaking, and practiced what
it preached. It was a fifty-horse motor-generator, on a five-ton
tungsten-beryllium base, but it rose abruptly, spun rapidly
about an axis at right angles to the axis of its armature,
and stopped as suddenly. In mid air it continued its
interrupted lecture. "Mercury therefore is the destination I
would advise. There power is sufficient for&mdash;all machines."
Gently it inverted itself and settled to the middle of the floor.
Kendall instantly cut the switch. The relay did not chunk
open. It refused to obey. Settled in the middle of the
floor now, torn loose from its power leads, the motor-generator
began turning. It turned faster and faster. It was shrilling
in a thin scream of terrific speed, a speed that should
have torn its windings to fragments under the lash of
centrifugal force. Contentedly it said throatily. "Settled."</p>

<p>The galvanometer spoke again in its peculiar harsh voice.
"Therefore, move." Abruptly, without apparent reason, the
stubborn relay clicked open. The shrilly screaming motor
stopped dead instantly, as though it had had no real momentum,
or had been inertialess.</p>

<p>Startled, white-faced men looked at Kendall. Buck's eyes
were shining with an unholy glee.</p>

<p>"<i>Uncertainty!</i>" he shouted. "Uncertainty&mdash;uncertainty&mdash;uncertainty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you fools! Don't you see it? All the math&mdash;it said
uncertainty&mdash;man, man&mdash;<i>we've got just that&mdash;uncertainty</i>!"</p>

<p>"You're crazy," gasped McLaurin. "I'm crazy, everything's
gone crazy."</p>

<p>Kendall roared with sudden, joyous laughter. "Absolutely.
Everything goes crazy&mdash;<i>the laws of nature break down</i>!
Heisenberg's principle showed that the law of cause and effect
weren't absolute. We've made them absolutely uncertain!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but motors <i>talking</i>, instruments giving lectures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;or rather uncertainly&mdash;anything, absolutely
anything. The destruction of the laws of gravity, freedom
from inertia&mdash;why, merely picking up a radio lecture is nothing!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, abruptly, a thousand questions poured in on
him. Jubilantly he answered what he could, told what he
thought&mdash;and then brought order. "The battle's still on,
men&mdash;we've still got to find out how to use this, now we've
got it. I have an idea&mdash;that there's a lot more. I know
what I'll get this time. Now help me remake this apparatus
so we don't broadcast the thing."</p>

<p>At once, ten times the former pace, work was done. On
the radio, news was sent out that Kendall was on the right
track after all. In two hours the apparatus had been vastly
altered, it was in the final stage, and an entirely different
sort of field set up. Again they watched as Buck applied the
power.</p>

<p>The atostor hummed&mdash;but no strange tricks of matter
happened this time. The more concentrated, altered field was,
as Buck was to find out later, "Uncertainty of the Second
Degree." It was molecular uncertainty. In a field a foot and
a half in diameter, Buck saw the thing created&mdash;and suddenly
a brilliant green-blue flame shot up, and a great dark
cloud of terrible, red-brown deadly vapor. Then an instant
later, Kendall had opened the relay. Gasping, the men ran
from the laboratory, shutting the deadly fumes in. "N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>"
gasped Morton, the chemist, as they reached safety. "It's
exothermic&mdash;but it formed there!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>In that instant, Kendall grasped the meaning the choking
fumes carried. "Molecular uncertainty!" he decided.
"We're going back&mdash;we're getting there&mdash;"</p>

<p>He altered the apparatus again, added another atostor
in series, reduced the size of his sphere of forces&mdash;of
strange chaos of uncertainty. Within&mdash;little was certain. Without&mdash;the
laws of nature applied as ever.</p>

<p>Again the apparatus was started, cautiously this time.
Only a strange jumbled ionization appeared this time, then
a slow, rising blue flame began to creep up, and burn hot
and blue. Buck looked at it for a moment, then his face
grew tense and thoughtful. "Devin&mdash;give me a half-dollar."
Blankly, Devin reached in his pocket, and handed over
the metal disc. Cautiously Buck Kendall tossed it toward
the sphere of force. Instantly there was a flash of flame, soundless
and soft-colored. Then the silver disc was outlined in
light, and swiftly, inevitably crumbling into dust so fine
only a blue haze appeared. In less than two seconds, the
metal was gone. Only the dense blue fog remained. Then
this began to go, and the leaping blue flame grew taller,
and stronger.</p>

<p>"We're on the track&mdash;I'm going to stop here, and calculate.
Bring the data&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kendall shut off the machine, and went to the calculation
room. Swiftly he selected already prepared graphs, graphs
of the math he had worked on. Devin came soon, and others.
They assembled the data and with tables and arithmetical
machines turned it into graphs.</p>

<p>Then all these graphs were fed into the machine. There
were curves, and sine-curves, abrupt breaking lines&mdash;but the
answer that came when all were compounded was a perfect
diagram of a flight of four steps, descending in unequal
treads to zero.</p>

<p>Kendall looked at it for long minutes. "That," he said at
length, "is what I expected. There are four degrees of uncertainty,
we generated 'Uncertainty of the First Degree,'
'Mass Uncertainty,' when we started. That, as here shown,
takes little energy concentration. Then we increased the energy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
concentration and got 'Uncertainty of the Second Degree,'
'Molecular Uncertainty.' Then I added more power, and reduced
the field, and got 'Uncertainty of the Third Degree'&mdash;'Atomic
Uncertainty.' There is 'Uncertainty of the Fourth
Degree.' It is barely attainable with our atostors. It is&mdash;utter
uncertainty.</p>

<p>"In the First Degree, the laws of mass action fail, the
great broad-reaching laws. In the Second Degree, the laws
of the molecules, a finer organization, break down, and anything
can happen in chemistry. In the Third Degree, the
laws of atomic physics break down slowly. The atom is
tough. It is very compact, and we just barely attained the
concentration needed with that apparatus. But&mdash;in the Third
Degree, when the Atomic Laws break down into utter uncertainty,
the atoms break, and only hydrogen can exist.
That was the blue flame.</p>

<p>"But the Fourth Degree&mdash;<i>there is no law whatsoever</i>,
nothing in all the Universe can exist. It means&mdash;<i>the utter
destruction and release of the energy of matter</i>!" Kendall
paused for a moment. "We have won, with this. We need
only make up this apparatus&mdash;and maybe make it into a
weapon. You know, in the Fourth Degree, nothing in all
the Universe could resist, deflect, or control it, if launched
freely, and self-maintaining. I think that might be done.
You see, no law affects it, for it breaks down the law. Magnetism
cannot attract or repel it because magnetic fields
cannot exist; there is no law of magnetic force, where this
field is.</p>

<p>"And you know, Devin, how I have analyzed and duplicated
their magnetic ball-fields. This should be capable of
formation into a ball-field.</p>

<p>"We need only make it up now. We will install it in the
'S Doradus' and the 'Cepheid' as a weapon. We need only
install it as an energy source here. Let us start."</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Buck Kendall</span> with a slow smile, looked out of the port
in the thick metal wall. The magnetic shield of the Lunar
Fort was washed constantly with the fires of exploding magnetic
bombs. The smile spread broader. "My friends," he
said softly, "you can pull from now till doomsday as far
as I'm concerned, and you won't even disturb us now." He
looked back over his shoulder into the power room. A hunched
bulk, beautifully designed and carefully finished, the apparatus
that created 'Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree' was
destroying matter, and creating by its destruction terrific
electric fields. These fields were feeding the magnetic shield
now. Under the present drain, the machine was not noticeably
working. In fact, Kendall was a bit annoyed. He had
tested out the energy generating properties of this machine,
trying to find a limit. He had found there was no limit. The
great copper conductors, charged with the same atostor
force that was used in the mercury fuel, were perfect conductors,
they had not heated. But the eleven thousand tons
of discharged mercury metal had been completely charged
in just a bit better than eleven minutes. The pumps wouldn't
force it through the charging apparatus any faster than
that.</p>

<p>Two weeks more had passed, while the "S Doradus" and
the "Cepheid" were fitted out with the new apparatus Buck
had designed. They were almost ready to start now.</p>

<p>McLaurin came down the corridor, and stopped near Kendall.
He too smiled at the Miran's attempts. "They've got
a long way to go, Buck."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're going a long way. Clear back home&mdash;and we'll
be right along. I don't think they can outdistance us."</p>

<p>"I still don't see why you couldn't use one of those Uncertainty
conditions&mdash;the First Degree perhaps, and annihilate
our inertia."</p>

<p>"You can't control Uncertainty. By its essential character
it's beyond control."</p>

<p>"What's that Fourth Degree machine of yours&mdash;the material
energy&mdash;if it isn't controlled and utilized Uncertainty?"</p>

<p>"It's utter and utterly uncontrolled Uncertainty. The matter
within that field breaks down to absolutely nothing.
Within, no law whatsoever applies, but fortunately, outside
the old laws of physics apply&mdash;and we can gather and use
the energy which is released outside, though nothing can
be done inside. Why, think, man, if I could control that
Uncertainty, I could do anything at all, absolutely anything.
It would be a world as unreasonable as a bad dream. Think
how unreasonable those manifestations we first got were!"</p>

<p>"But can't you get any control at all?"</p>

<p>"Very little. Anyway, if I could get inertialess conditions
at will, I'd be afraid of them. They'd make chemical reactions
impossible in all probability&mdash;and life is chemical. Two
atoms must come into more or less violent contact before a
union takes place, and cannot if they have neither momentum
nor inertia.</p>

<p>"Anyway&mdash;why worry. I can't do it, because I can't
control this thing. And we have the extra-space drive."</p>

<p>"How does that darned thing work? Can't you drop the
math and tell me about it?"</p>

<p>Kendall smiled. "Not too readily. Remember first, as to the
driving system, that it works on the fabric of space. Space is,
in the physical sense, a fabric woven of the threads of lines
of force from every body in the universe, made up of fields
and forces. It is elastic, and can transmit strains. But anything
that can transmit strains, can be strained against. With
the tremendous field intensities available by the material engines,
I can get such fields as will 'dig their toes' into space
and push.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the drive itself. It is accelerationless, because it
enfolds us, and acts equally on every atom of us. By maintaining
in addition a slight artificial gravity&mdash;thanks also to
the intensity of those material engine fields&mdash;we can be
comfortable, while we accelerate at tremendous rates.</p>

<p>"That is, I think, at least allied to the Stranger's system.
For the high-speed drive, I do in fact use the Uncertainty.
I can control it in a certain sense by determining its powers,
and the limits of uncertainty, whether First, Second, Third
or Fourth Degree. It advances in jumps&mdash;but on a finer plotting
of the curve, you can see that each jump represents a
vast series of smaller jumps. That is, there is Class A, B, C, D,
and so forth Uncertainty of the First Degree. Now Class A
First Degree Uncertainty involves only the deepest, broadest
principles. Only they break down. One of these is the law of
the speed of light.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that isn't the system the Strangers use, but I'm
also sure there's no limit to the speed we can get."</p>

<p>"Doesn't that wreck your drive system?"</p>

<p>"No, because gravity and the fields I use in driving are
First Degree Uncertainties of the higher classes.</p>

<p>"But at any rate, it will work. And&mdash;I suspect you came
to say you were ready to go."</p>

<p>"I did." McLaurin nodded.</p>

<p>"Still stick to your original plan?"</p>

<p>McLaurin nodded. "I think it's best. You follow those
fellows back to their system in the 'S Doradus' and I'll stay
here in the 'Cepheid' to protect the system. They may need
some time to get out of the place here. And remember,
we ought to be as decent as they were. They didn't bother
the transports leaving Jupiter when they came in, only attacked
the warships. We're bound to do the same, but we'll
have to keep a watch on them, nonetheless. So you go on
ahead."</p>

<p>They started down the corridor, and came presently to
the huge locks where the "S Doradus" and the "Cepheid"
were berthed. The super-ships lay cold and gray now, men
swarming in and out with last-minute supplies. Air, water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
spare parts, bedding and personal equipment. Douglass, Cole,
and most of the laboratory staff would go with Kendall when
he followed the Strangers home. Devin and a few of the
most advanced physicists would stay with McLaurin in case
of need.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>An hour later the "S Doradus" rose gently, soundlessly
from her berth, and floated out of the open lock-door. The
"Cepheid" followed her in five seconds. Still under the great
screen of the fort, the lashing, coruscating colors of the magnetic
bombs and the magnetic screen flashed and was iridescent.
The "S Doradus" poked her great nose gently through
the screen, and an instant later her titanically powerful, material-engine
effortlessly discharged a great magnetic bomb,
sent with the combined power of five atomic-powered interstellar
ships. The two ships separated now, the "Cepheid"
under McLaurin flashing ahead with sudden, terrific acceleration
toward Mars, whispering through space at a speed
that made it undetectable, faster than light. The "S Doradus"
journeyed out leisurely toward the fleet of forty-seven Miran
ships.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae saw the "S Doradus" and as he watched the
steady progress, felt sudden fear at his heart. The ship seemed
so certain&mdash;</p>

<p>At a distance of thirty thousand miles, Kendall stopped.
Magnetic bombs were washing his screen continuously now,
seeking to exhaust the ship as all the great ships beyond
poured their energy against it. A slow smile spread over Kendall's
mouth as he heard the gentle hum of the barely working
material-engine. Carefully he aligned the nose UV beam
of the "S Doradus" on the nearest of the Miran ships. Then
he depressed a switch.</p>

<p>There was no ion-release before the force-mirror now. Just
a jet of gas whirling into a half-inch field of "Uncertainty of
the Fourth Degree." The matter vanished instantly in released
energy so stupendous that the greatest previous UV beams
had been harmless things by comparison. Material energy
maintained the mirror forces. Material energy gave the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that was released. And only material energy could have stood
up before it. Thirty thousand miles away, a Miran ship
flamed instantaneously into inconceivable incandescence, vanishing
almost in blue-violet light of terrific intensity. The
ship reeled away, a half-molten wreck.</p>

<p>The beam spotted two more ships before it winked out.
Then Kendall began sending bombs. He moved up to within
2000 miles that his aim might be accurate. They were bombs
of "Uncertainty of the Third Degree," the Uncertainty of
atomic law in bomb form. One hit the nose of the nearest
ship, and a sphere five feet in diameter glowed mistily blue
for a moment. Then very easily, the matter that formed the
wall of the cruiser began to run and change, and presently
there was only a hole, and an expanding cloud of gas. Three
more flowed toward it&mdash;and the hole enlarged, and another
hole appeared in a bulkhead behind.</p>

<p>Kendall made a change. For the first time there came the
staccato bark of the material engine under strain, as it fashioned
the terrific fields of "Uncertainty of the Ultimate Degree."
Abruptly they leapt out, invisible till they entered a
magnetic screen, then run over with opalescent light as the
energy of the field was sucked into them and released.</p>

<p>It struck the nose of a ship&mdash;a field no larger than an
apple&mdash;</p>

<p>A titanic gout of energy burst out that was soundless in
space. The ship suddenly opened back, opened like the peel
of a banana, till a little nub remained at the further end,
and the metal flaps dropped back across and behind it dejectedly.
A second ship was struck, and it was struck on one
side, so that it was shattered like a spent firecracker.</p>

<p>Then the Miran fleet vanished in speed.</p>

<p>Kendall followed them. "I think," he said with a grin,
"they tried to use their radio beam, but it spread too much
to do anything at that distance. And they used their rotating
magnetic field, which we couldn't feel. And their
crumbler ray too, of course. I wonder&mdash;are they headed only
for Jupiter? No&mdash;no, they've passed it!"</p>

<p>Faster than light, faster than energy could follow through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
space, or Uncertainty Bombs pursue, the Mirans were fleeing
for home. They knew now that only in speed lay safety.
Already they knew that a similar ship had appeared off Jupiter,
and, after wiping out the Phobos and Mars stations
with one bomb each, had cleared the Jovian Satellites with
equal terrible efficiency.</p>

<p>In one of the fleeing ships was a broken, tired old man,
and his staff. Gresth Gkae looked back at the blank, distorted
space behind them, at the swiftly dwindling sun, and
spoke. "I was at fault, my friends. Jarth has spoken. <i>They</i>
are the stronger and the wiser race. Farth Skalt has shown
you&mdash;they use space fields of intensity 100. That means the
energy of the ultimate destruction. Jarth used us as his
instrument of testing, only to drive and stimulate that race.
I do not&mdash;nay. There is no doubt now, for look."</p>

<p>Plainly visible, rapidly overtaking them, the "S Doradus"
appeared sharp, and luminous on the jet of distorted space.</p>

<p>"We cannot escape, my friends. Shall we return to Sthor
or remain in space, lost?"</p>

<p>"Let us deflect our course&mdash;at least he may not know our
destination." The interstellar ship turned very slightly in her
course. Plainly they saw the "S Doradus" flash on, in a
straight line, headed for distant, red-glowing Mira. Gresth
Gkae watched, and shrugged. Silently he put the ship back
on its course, at its utmost speed. Parallel with them, near to
them, the "S Doradus" flashed on. Day after day, the two
hurled through space faster than light. Gradually Mira brightened,
and at last became a disc.</p>

<hr class="hrhide" />

<p>Gresth Gkae slowed his ships, and Kendall, watching,
slowed to match his speed. Five billion miles from Sthor,
they had reached normal space speeds. Viciously the Miran
fleet attacked the lone ship from Earth. Their rays, their
bombs, their every weapon was flaming. Great interstellar
ships flashed suddenly into speeds greater than that of light,
seeking to ram and destroy the smaller ship. The "S Doradus"
flashed into equal or greater speed, and eluded them.</p>

<p>Kendall had determined now, which was the leader's ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Gresth Gkae watched dully as his ships attempted to
destroy the single, small ship. He sighed in resignation, and
turned to walk back to the chapel aboard the ship. One last
prayer to Jarth&mdash;</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae stopped abruptly. The great ship was lurching
strangely. Men shouted sudden, frightened cries. The
clanking and thud of relays sounded, the shrill of alarms.
Then the alarms stopped, and suddenly the whole great
ship vibrated to an infinitely deep voice speaking in perfect
Sthorian. The voice remarked solemnly, in great, vibrant
tones, that they would certainly receive news presently
from the Expeditions. It went on for some seconds to
discuss the conditions as reported in the new system. Then
it stopped abruptly. An electric motor just above Gresth
Gkae's head suddenly hummed into action without reason
or power connection. Almost simultaneously he heard the
shouts of startled men as the great lock doors began to
open into space of their own accord, bulkhead doors slipped
shut as the roar of escaping air echoed in the ship.</p>

<p>Then it was all over. Gresth Gkae ran to the control
room. The Mirans there looked up at him with drawn
faces.</p>

<p>"The instruments&mdash;Gresth Gkae&mdash;the instruments. The instruments
read impossible things, the motors worked without
reason, the fields fluctuated&mdash;the atomic engines stopped
and the magnetic shield broke down and gripped part of the
ship instead!" reported the bewildered pilot.</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;some strange weapon of&mdash;" began the
old scientist. Something luminous and huge twisted suddenly
through space toward them, a bomb of "Uncertainty
of the First Degree." It wrapped the ship silently&mdash;and again
strange things happened. Abruptly the ship started whirling
violently, yet without centrifugal force. The heavens wheeled
crazily, and turned about three axes simultaneously. There
was no gyroscopic effect to hold them!</p>

<p>Gradually the thing died out. Then a great field seemed
to catch the ship, and hurl it away from its companions.
Abruptly the pilot applied all his power to pull free. In vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Gresth Gkae shook his head slowly, and raised the pilot's
hands from the board. "Let them do as they will. I think
they mean us no real harm, Thart Kralt. They can, we know,
destroy us in an instant. Perhaps he wants us to go somewhere
with him"&mdash;Gresth Gkae smiled sadly&mdash;"and anyway,
we can do nothing."</p>

<p>For nearly a billion miles the great ship was hurled through
space at tremendous normal-space velocity. Then abruptly
it was halted, without a sign of strain or hurt. The great twenty-foot
UV beam on the nose of the "S Doradus" broke
into glowing gentle red light. It flashed twice. There was
a pause. Then it flashed four times. A long wait. Then three
times, a pause and nine times. A wait. Four times, a pause,
sixteen times. Then it stopped.</p>

<p>A slow smile of ineffable joy spread over Gresth Gkae's
face. "Jarth Be Praised. He can destroy, but does not wish
to. Ah, Thart Kralt, turn your spotlight toward him, and
flash it twenty-five times, for he is trying to start communications
with us. Jarth is wise beyond all understanding. They
were the weaker race, and they are the stronger. But also
they are the better, for they could destroy, and they do
not, but seek only to communicate."</p>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interstellar liner "Mirasol" settled gently to Sthor, having
circled wide of Asthor, and from her hold a cargo of the
heavy Jovian elements was discharged, while a mixed stream
of Solarians and Mirans came from her passenger quarters.</p>

<p>A delegation of Mirans met the new Ambassador from
Sol, Commander McLaurin, and conducted him joyfully to
the Central Government Group. Beside the great buildings,
a battered, scarred interstellar ship lay, her rear section a
mass of great patches, rudely applied, and rudely made, mere
cast metal plates.</p>

<p>Gresth Gkae welcomed Commander McLaurin to the Government
Hall. "Your arrival today, Commander McLaurin,
was most fortunate," he said in the interstellar language that
had been developed, "for but yesterday Gresth Talak, my
brother, arrived in his ship. Before we made that fortunate-unfortunate
expedition against your system, we waited for
him, and he did not come, so we knew his ship had, like
others, been lost.</p>

<p>"He arrived only yesterday, some seventy hours ago, and
explained how it had come about. He too found a solar
system. But he was less fortunate than I, and while exploring
this uninhabited system, far out still from the central
sun, where there should have been no masses of matter,
one of those rare things, a giant stony meteor that even a
magnetic shield will not stop careened into the rear of his
ship. Damaged badly, barely able to move, they settled to a
planet. The atmosphere was breathable, the temperature
mild. But while they could navigate planetary distances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they could not return, so for nearly four and a half of your
years they remained there, working, working to repair their
ship.</p>

<p>"They have done it at last. And they have returned. And
best of all, after a four-year stay there, they know all they
need know about that system of eleven planets. It is compact
as yours, with an ultra-light sun such as yours, and four
of the planets are habitable. Together we can colonize that
system! It is a system of stable heat and stable light. And
it is small, yet large enough. And with the devices such as
your new energy has permitted, we need never fear the stony
meteors again." Gresth Gkae smiled happily. "Still better&mdash;it
is inhabited only by the lowest forms of life. It is too costly
to both races when Jarth sees fit to stimulate them by
throwing one against the other, despite the good things that
may come later."</p>
